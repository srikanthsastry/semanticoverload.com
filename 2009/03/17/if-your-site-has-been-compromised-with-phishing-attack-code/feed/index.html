		<description><![CDATA[step 1 : change FTP password
Step 2 : Download all files and clean
Step 3 : upload Files
Step 4 : Set 444 permission to all files, except Custom Upload folders

Remeber Do not save FTP password in  your FTP client
If you suspects that your system is infected, Format and install OS, then install a good antivirus + firewall. I suggest Avast free edition and Comodo Firewall.

We have received many inquiries and we cleaned those infected sites. If your site is infected Please contact us

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your post, it was extremely helpful! This same exact issue just happened to me last week -- Wachovia bank security aler. I am now unable to send my URL to anyone through email due to the phishing attack code now logged with my site. I know nothing about how you fixed it, but I will forward your link to my web people. I am still dealing with the clean-up. I now think that I have a trojan or some other kind of spyware on my Mac, as many &quot;phishy&quot; things continue to occur that make me suspicious. Thank you again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@patrix That&#039;s a great question! Honestly, there is no foolproof mechanism to do that. Often, the CMS engines you use themselves have security vulnerabilities that are often exploited by hackers to insert such malicious code.
Having said that, there are mechanisms to mitigate the vulnerabilities, but they come with a price. For instance, you can give read-and-execute only permissions to all your files and directories. This ensures that the hackers don&#039;t have the requisite permissions to install such code. But that means that you can&#039;t upload images or do automatic upgrades from the front-end. So everytime you want to &#039;write&#039; (or add or modify) any file to your website from the browser you will have to temporarily give write permissions to the necessary files and directories and then revert the permissions back after you are done.

So, in short, there is no guaranteed mechanism to prevent such attacks. Like I mentioned towards the end of this post: it&#039;s a cat-and-mouse game that the CMS developers and website owners play with hackers, with each group trying to outdo the other. Sorry, I couldn&#039;t be more helpful regarding this. Perhaps an expert on network and web security could provide a more insightful commmentery on it.]]></description>
