				<h2 class="entry-title">On the Institution of Marriage</h2>
				<div class="entry-content">
<p>Given that marriage is an institution of great importance across many (if not all) cultures, it is not unreasonable to expect some sort of a definition of marriage. Ironically, <a title="Anthropological definitions of marriage" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage#Anthropological_definitions">anthropologists are yet to agree on such a definition</a>! So when I am told that its time I got married, I am genuinely confused as to what exactly does that entail. Of course, it does not help that the institution itself has been constantly changing over time (<a title="History of Marriage as an Institution in the west" href="http://www.pflagsanjose.org/advocacy/hist.html">Here is a hypertext document that tracks such changes in the western hemisphere</a>, and in the east, especially India, marriage has undergone many changes ranging from abolition of the <a title="Sati practice" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_%28practice%29">Sati practice</a>; <a title="Special Marriage Act of 1954" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Marriage_Act,_1954">legalization of marriage across caste and religion</a>; and <a title="Hindu Succession Action of 1956" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu_Succession_Act_,1956">the change in the inheritance</a> and <a title="Indian Divorce Action of 1869" href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Indian_Divorce_Act">alimony</a> laws). So my query is the following: What exactly is the institution of marriage?</p>
<p><span id="more-324"></span></p>
<p>The it-is-how-you-choose-to-interpret-the-term answer to the foregoing question is (1) a cop-out, (2) an unsatisfying response, and (3) exposes an inherent flaw in the nature of the institution. Yes, marriage, much like other institutions created by humans is flawed, and the way I see it, it is flawed in a very interesting way. This flaw was not problematic for a very long time in the human society, but I think the cracks are beginning to widen right about now in the human history. But what do I mean by that? I have given you two (potentially provocative) sentences with no information in them. Although I would like to expand on my conjecture, I cannot do it without proving you with a background on what I view Marriage to be. So this post will focus on my view of the institution of Marriage, and a future post will defend my position that marriage itself is flawed (but not in an irredeemable fashion).</p>
<p>The institution of marriage, in my opinion, has conflated three different, but related, institutions: (1) a personal institution, denoted <em>pMarriage</em>, (2) a social institution, denoted <em>sMarriage</em>, and (3) a legal institution, denoted <em>lMarriage</em>. A lot of the hoopla about the disintegration of Marriage in the society is, I think, because we have not been able to understand how these three institutions interact to maintain Marriage. Let me define these three institutions before proceeding further.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>pMarriage</strong></em>: A personal institution.
<ul>
<li>In general terms, a personal institution is one that exists solely within the confines of the participating individuals. It can be viewed as a personal contract between the two people. <strong>pMarriage</strong> is a specific form of personal institution that has romantic and/or sexual component in the personal contract to which the participating individuals have affirmed. Note that many marriages carry <strong>pMarriage </strong>within them<strong></strong>; and Marriages in which <strong>pMarriage</strong> has ceased to exist are often termed &#8216;loveless&#8217; marriages. These are marriages that are &#8216;surviving&#8217; on <strong>sMarriage</strong> (the social institution) and/or <strong>lMarriage</strong> (the legal institution) alone. Such Marriages are common in societies where divorce carries a social stigma.</li>
<li>But can <strong>pMarriage</strong> exists in isolation? If so, then can it still be called a marriage? The answers are &#8216;yes&#8217;, and &#8216;no&#8217;, respectively. We have many terms to describe <strong>pMarriage</strong> (in isolation) depending on the specifics of the contract within each instance. Popular examples of <strong>pMarriage</strong> are couples who are &#8216;just dating&#8217; (Note that this does not include couples who are in a &#8216;committed &#8216; relationship, because that includes the social institution <strong>sMarriage</strong>) and &#8216;<a title="Friends with benefits" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casual_relationship">friends with benefits</a>&#8216;. The more unpopular examples of <strong>pMarriage</strong> are extramarital affairs and <a title="Emotional Affair" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_affair">emotional affairs</a>. Note that in none of the foregoing examples would you consider the individuals &#8216;married&#8217;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>sMarriage</strong></em>: A social institution.
<ul>
<li>In general terms, a social institution is one that plays a role in maintaining the stability of the society. There is tendency of equate Marriage and <strong>sMarriage</strong> simply because Marriage is often seen as a social institution with legal support for its perpetuity. <strong>sMarriage</strong> can be seen as a contract in which the individuals within the marriage (specifically, <strong>sMarriage</strong>) present themselves, and are seen by other members of the society as, a unified entity. Clearly, many Marriages embed <strong>sMarriage</strong> within them. But this may not be the case in all Marriages. A classic example of a Marriage devoid of <strong>sMarriage</strong> is couples who are &#8216;separated&#8217;. Note that couples who are separated often do not have <strong>pMarriage</strong> between them either (their Marriage is often just the legal institution of <strong>lMarriage</strong>, and for social purposes they are seen as divorced, but for legal purposes, they are still viewed as being married).</li>
<li>Now, can <strong>sMarriage</strong> exist without <strong>pMarriage</strong>? It seems very unlikely that individuals in the social institution would not be in a personal institution as well. However, there are cases where this could be true. For example, you could have individuals of opposite sex who are both gay (and still in the closet about it) and marry each other because they are tried of everyone in the family setting them up with &#8216;potential&#8217; spouses. This placates the families because the families see the <strong>sMarriage</strong> (in conjunction with the legal institution of <strong>lMarriage</strong>) as Marriage, and it allows the individuals to pursue their own personal institutions of <strong>pMarriage</strong> with different individuals. I could give you a more common example of an individual marrying someone due to family pressure while having an affair with someone else, but in this case the status of <strong>pMarriage</strong> between the married couple is unclear and I&#8217;d rather not muddy the waters here. I am trying to get a concept across here, not the nuances.</li>
<li>We saw how <strong>sMarriage</strong> could exist without <strong>pMarriage</strong>, but in the example I gave, <strong>sMarriage</strong> was &#8216;propped&#8217; up by the legal institution of <strong>lMarriage</strong>. A natural question is: can <strong>sMarriage</strong> exist in isolation then? I think it could, but I cannot substantiate it with hard evidence. One such situation could be the following: In orthodox and conservative societies, it is plausible for two individuals who are married, to has irreconcilable differences, get a divorce, but for the sake of the children and the extended family (i.e. the social stigma), continue to live together and be a &#8216;family&#8217;. Here is an example (albeit fictitious, at least to my knowledge) where <strong>pMarriage</strong> and <strong>lMarriage</strong> (the legal contract of Marriage dissolves with a divorce) no longer exists, but <strong>sMarriage</strong> continues to thrive in isolation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>lMarriage</strong></em>: A legal institution.
<ul>
<li><strong>lMarriage</strong>, is perhaps, the easiest one to understand. <strong>lMarriage</strong> is the legal marriage contract signed between two individual that grants them certain rights and responsibilities (unless explicitly forbidden under a <a title="Prenuptial Agreement" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenuptial_agreement">prenuptial agreement</a>). Such rights and responsibilities include inheritance, visitation rights, tax exemptions, alimony, entitlement as &#8216;<a title="Next of Kin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_of_kin">next of kin</a>&#8216;, and such.</li>
<li><strong>lMarriage</strong> is often used to recognize Marriage in the contrapositive. That is, you might not be necessarily perceived as &#8216;married&#8217; if you are in an lMarriage (e.g. you are separated from your spouse), but are defined perceived as &#8216;NOT married&#8217; if you are NOT in an <strong>lMarriage</strong>. Needless to say, an individual could be in an lMarriage with some person regardless of whether or not the individual is in a <strong>pMarriage</strong> or an <strong>sMarriage</strong> with that same person. In other words, <strong>lMarriage</strong> could exist in isolation, or in combination with pMarriage and/or sMarriage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While I admit that I may not be completely accurate in my characterization of Marriage, I think this is yet a useful tool to understanding the institution. However, this does raise many questions. For instance, when you say that you are &#8216;married&#8217;, which institution(s) are you referring to? All three? Only a subset? A more nuanced and difficult question to answer is: when would you consider a marriage to have failed? Often, the success or failure of a marriage is determined solely bases on the integrity of the<strong> lMarriage</strong> within the Marriage. In fact, this forms the basis for the argument that Indian marriages (often <a title="Arranged Marriage" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arranged_marriage">arranged</a>) are more successful than marriages in the west. What about the role of Marriage towards fostering a healthier individual and a healthier society? How successful are today&#8217;s marriages in this regard?</p>
<p>On more question to end this post. Has our conflation of multiple institutions into a single institution of Marriage contributed to the continual failure of Marriage as perceived by many [<a title="Marriage is no longer relevant in today's society" href="http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=182222">here</a>, <a title="Can marriage survive in today's society?" href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Can-Marriage-Survive-in-Todays-Society?&amp;id=1828131">here</a>, and <a title="Marriage Crisi: Is the sacred union in danger?" href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/75924/the_marriage_crisis_is_the_sacred_union.html">here</a>], and if so, then does treating Marriage as a combination of multiple institutions enable it to be adapted and morphed according to changing needs of the society and thereby continue to be successful and relevant?</p>
