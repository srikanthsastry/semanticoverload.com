		<description><![CDATA[continued from my earlier post: North india is fully islamic. North temples chant in hindi (persian language) and built on islamic architecture, south temples are built on vedic sastra &amp; chant in sanskrti. North indian fair race is worshipping dark dravidian gods - Rama, Krishna, Shiva &amp; Vishnu. Puranas, Vedas, Ramayana &amp; Mahabarat all of them openly say these are dark gods. south dravidian kings who conquered thailand, cambodia etc.. propagated Ramayana, estabilished Ayodha &amp; propagated sasnkrit becos it was their langauge. not same fake aryan race !. Vivekananda &amp; others revided hinduism in north after British came to india &amp; then you know what our good mixed persian race friends started claiming it is their religion, langauge etc.. but forgot to change the gods color - LOL !! All crimes leave a clue for us to find the truth. truth is immortal &amp; god itself. Jai Dravidians !]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[True History: Dravidians rules the entire country for 1000&#039;s of years. Harrapan &amp; Mahenjodaro are dravidian civilizaiton. Afganistan has a dravidian people &amp; language (Brahui still). Rama Krishna Shiva &amp; Vishnu are Dark dravidian gods. Manu is a south indian king who wrote manusmriti, caste system  is a dravidian origin. Vedas/puranas, Ramayana &amp; Mahabarat are mythology not based on historical personalities. south dravidian kings conquered Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia &amp; established Ayodhya in each of these countries, becos they ruled their empires in the name of lord Rama. They propagated sanskrit in all these countries. There was NO sanskrit in north india during Asokan empire, documented by all researchers. Sanskrit, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Tulu, Koda, Malayalam are the true dravidian languages of this country. thats why Telugu is 70%sanskrit, Kannada, Tamil &amp; Telugu are 50% sanskrti. Dravidian kingdom was named after the gods, madurai is Land of Nectar, Hampi land of kishkinda, Lanka - land of asuras, so dravidian kingdoms are based on the puranas. dravidian kings established all new kingdoms - north india, thailand, indonesia, malayasia, cambodia based on Ramayana. North is a fully mixed race with persian invaders who killed all men/childern &amp; raped all the women in north. Hindi &amp; north languages are persian languages, &amp; genetically persians are closer to central asia - fake aryan fair race !!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi dear patnaik,
  I went through ur comment, I appreciate for ur insight, Iranians (persians) were dieties of fire and water, tablets found in 1500bc in their religion says they devoted indra, mitra and varuna and the names are inscribed as they are. so did persians are few who are brothers who left India between 3500bc and 1500bc? after persians invading indus valley and then greeks, were we influenced and moved into idol worship? these are few questions I have. I didnt know weather to laugh or pitty the person who said mahabali and ramayana are the same. let lord shower all the mercy on him.

		<description><![CDATA[History is story written by the winning side. If you consider Ramayan is history, you know its worth. As regards the Arya Dravida theory, it is enough for the silly web designers to learn that the real Indian civilization is civilization that prospered in the plains of rivers Indus, Ganges and Saraswati, with branches in south India.Violent tribals from Iran crossed mountains and ravaged the prosperous Indian civilization. Many were murdered and vast populace moved south. Some surrendered and stayed as the coolies of those sub human plunderers. Now it is for you to decide whether you are genetically closer to Iranians or Indians. Forget the theory of Aryan or Dravidian. Whoever won those dats, called himself Arya or civilized.. You fools donot know that Assyrians call themselves ASURS and Syrians call themselves SURAs. How on Indian soil Sura and Asura fight was going on?? Have some common sense, do some reading before writing.]]></description>
