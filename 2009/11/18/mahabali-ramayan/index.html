<p>What if the story of <a title="The story of Mahabali" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabali">Mahabali</a> and <a title="Ramayana" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana">Ramayan</a> were narrating the same episode in ancient Indian history?

<h3>The story of King Mahabali</h3>
<p>Mahabali was the king of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asura"><em>asuras</em></a> (who are a class of deites, and not demons; demons are called <a title="Rakshasa in Hindu Mythology" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakshasa"><em>rakshasas</em></a> in Hindu mythology). The asuras ruled in Paatala loka (which is one of the 14 worlds, and is not hell; hell is called <a title="Naraka in Hindu Mythology" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naraka"><em>Narka</em></a> in Hindu mythology). Mahabali expanded his empire to all the 7 &#8216;lower&#8217; worlds and then invaded <em>Bhuloka</em> (or the earthly world): the lowest of the 7 &#8216;higher&#8217; worlds. Then he set his eyes on the remaining &#8216;higher&#8217; worlds which were ruled by <a title="Devas" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deva_(Hinduism)"><em>devas</em></a> (another class of deities). The king of devas, Indra, was worried by this expansion and realized that he was no match for Mahabali, so he approached lord Vishnu to save his kingdom. Vishnu then took the form of <em>vamana</em>, or a brahmin boy, and approached Mahabali for <em>Daana</em> or donation/alms. Vamana asked for three steps of land for him to live in. Mahabali agreed. Then Vamana grew so large that in one step he covered all of the higher worlds, and in another step he covered the Bhuloka, and asked Mahabali where he should place his third step. Realizing that he has been bested, Mahabali asked the third step to be put on his head and Vishnu placed his third step on Mahabali&#8217;s head sending him to Paatala.</p>
<h3>The story of Ramayana (hopelessly abridged)</h3>
<p>Prince Rama is sent on an exile with his wife and brother. They wander to south of Vindhya mountains and down south, king Ravana of Lanka abducts Rama&#8217;s wife. While searching for his wife he comes across a kingdom of monkeys (<em>vanaras</em>) and with their help he defeats Ravana and rescues his wife.</p>
<h3>Obvious connections</h3>
<p>So how do these stories point to Aryans and Dravidians? The most obvious references here are (a)the notion of Mahabali being from the &#8216;lower&#8217; world (possibly refering to south India) and the devas and Vishnu being from the &#8216;higher&#8217; workd (possibly refering to north India, and (b) Rama being an <em>Arya putra</em> from Ayodhya (in north India) and Ravana being from Lanka (in the south) and the Dravidian people being referred to as &#8216;monkeys&#8217;.</p>
<p>But we need more than such annotated instrumentation to make our case.</p>
<h3>Mahabali and Onam</h3>
<p>First, lets look at the case of Mahabali. King Mahabali is said to been a very just king and all of his subjects were said to have lived properously during his reign. Yet he is cast down back to Paatala. Also, Paatala could well refer to the state of Kerala (again, in the south) because the Hindu  festival of<a title="Onam" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onam"> Onam</a> celerbrated only in Kerala is a celebration of King Mahabali, <em>their</em> King Mahabali. It is worth noting that Hindus in Kerala celebrate the reign of an asura king who was cast down by Vishnu and interestingly, such a celebration is endemic to Kerala. It is not celebrated anywhere else!</p>
<h3>Vijayadashami in north and south India</h3>
<p>In north India the Hindu festival of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijayadashami">Vijayadashami</a> marks the defeat of Ravana by Rama. However, in south India, the same festival marks the defeat of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahishasura">Mahishaura</a> by Durga. Why such different reasons to mark the same festival? The only bridge between the two is the tale that Rama performed a sacrifice to Durga in the eve of the battle with Ravana. This suggests that these were really two different festivals in two different cultures and religions. They were later joined together by expansion of Hinduism into all of India.</p>
<h3>The legend of Vindhya and Agasthya</h3>
<p>The legend is that Vindhya mountains (which separates north and south India) started growing to such heights that it challenged the path of sun in the sky. So sage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agastya">Agastya</a>, in order to stop this growth asked Vindhyas to stoop down so that he may cross to down south. He also extracted a promise that Vindhyas would not grow any higher until he returned back north. But Agastya permanently settled in the south, and so the Vindhyas did not grow anymore.</p>
<p>The story (which is from the puranas, and is said to have occured before the itihaasas) can be interpreted as the northerners&#8217; (Aryans) conquest over the Vindhyas (much like the conquest of Mt. Everest) which paved way for migration to south India, thus triggering contact with the south Indian Dravidians.</p>
<h3>Genetic Markers, Caste System, and the North-South Divide</h3>
<p>A recently published <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/genetics/article6846424.ece">study of genetic profiles of Indian peoples</a> concludes a distinct divide among Ancestral North Indian (ANI) tribes and Ancestral South Indian (ASI) tribes with very strong evidence of enogamy. The study  also revealed that individuals descending from the ANI tribes tend to be in the &#8216;higher castes&#8217; and are genetically closer to europeans where as individuals descending from the ASI tribes tend to be in the &#8216;lower castes&#8217;. This again points to an Aryan-Dravidian divide that has been there for millenia, and the strong enogamy suggests conflict and competition between the groups, and looks like the Aryans won the struggle and encoded it into their mythology which was then shared with the Dravidians when they all became a single Hindu people, yet isolated from each other by caste barriers.</p>
