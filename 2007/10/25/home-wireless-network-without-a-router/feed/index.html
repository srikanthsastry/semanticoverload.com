Here is an article on the Microsoft website on how to share a PPPoE connection. Let me know if this works for you, if it doesn&#039;t then lets take this discussion on email.

		<description><![CDATA[Yo Overload,

I&#039;ve tried this at home. but the problem is that I have a PPPOE internet connection that simply doesn&#039;t want to share itself. Is there way out of this? Pain in the ass really. My router PC, so to speak, is a Dell Laptop with a wireless USB stick adapter. The network works, I get it on my other laptop, the internet is working well of course on the Dell. But no access otherwise.

Is there any other trick to share the PPPOE connection?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Vivek:
You are right in stating that the PC has to be switched on for the routing to work. But as far as longer life of the PC goes.... I have had my PC for over 3 years now and its seldom been switched off. Now with Vista coming out, my PC is fast becoming outdated. So I am not too sure if it would shorten the life of the PC. Besides turning your PC off all night should be more than sufficient to take care of any machine fatigue that the PC may endure during the day.

As far as needing a PCI-based wireless card for desktops go - there are several cheaper USB based cards available in the market today. I would recommend that people go for these USB cards simple because they are easy to install and extremely portable.

The biggest drawback of this mechanism is the bad scalability numbers. The available band width decreases as the number of wireless clients go up. In fact, this decrease is not gradual or graceful; the decrease is of factorial magnitude! For n wireless clients there is a (n-1)! decrease in bandwidth. So you can use this mechanism for three wireless clients at most. In fact, that is exactly the kind of users who will want this solution to begin with. If you have many wireless clients, then you are better off investing in a router to begin with.]]></description>
