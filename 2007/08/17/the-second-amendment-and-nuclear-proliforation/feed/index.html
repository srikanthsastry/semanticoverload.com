		<description><![CDATA[@Rambodoc: That is my point! Just like there are no implementable laws for the entire globe, there are no implementable laws for an entire society (hence the term &#039;anti-social&#039;). The writ of UN doesn&#039;t run everywhere, neither does the rule of law in some violent neighborhoods and mafia strongholds (unless there is an all out war with the law enforcement).
I agree with you that rogue states should not be allowed to get nukes, but the fact of the matter is that they can, and there is little to suggest that they are NOT trying to get it. Given the reality of this threat, and any country living with such a threat to its sovereignty will either choose to act in defense and go nuclear, or become planet dust.
This is, in fact, the same argument (applied analogously) used by gun advocates too. Bad guys will procure guns, whether its legal or not, if we have to protect ourselves from them, then we need guns too, hence liberalize gun laws.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very attractive argument with a fatal flaw in it.
The gun control context is within a society where a government of laws is in control of deciding the playing fields and the settings. In the world, there are no uniformly implementable laws because there is no one World Government. The writ of the UN does not run everywhere, as you know. Hence, rogue states should not be allowed to get N weapons. But who&#039;s doing anything these days? I think the CIA and Mossad have become too effeminate and wimpy (to mix metaphors obnoxiously) to stop all this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well said and a good analogy. But to expect this administration to make logical or non-hypocritical decisions is too much, no?

PS. you might want to lose the border for your Adsense blocks. And your sidebar block doesn&#039;t seem to have the same background (slightly darker). The below title block has the right one though.]]></description>
