				<h2 class="entry-title">Stupid Criminals!</h2>
				<div class="entry-content">
<p>I guess there is something in the air, or water, or go-knows-what that seems to have triggered the stupid gene on criminals around here. In two days I saw/heard two cases of criminal stupidity (pun intended) that simply blew my mind away! How could Darwin have been so wrong to the point where these idiots continue to survive?! I have read the forward about stupid criminals, and read the stories on the Internet, but when you see it happen, its a different feeling. Kinda shocks you feeling sorry for the human race for letting genes like these propagate.</p>
<p><span id="more-112"></span></p>
<p>The first incident happened last Sunday,  August 19th. We (me and my homies), went to a Mexican restaurant for a late dinner. It was 9 or so in the evening. Behind one of our table was a table with four people. They ordered 4 iced teas and some chips, or something really inexpensive. After they were done, just got up and walked out; they walked straight into a cop at the door. A few minutes later the cop asked they waitress to come out. At this point I was concern for the waitress. The alcohol laws in Texas are very stringent. Its the wait staff&#8217;s responsibility to make sure that alcohol ordered by someone over 21 is not given to a minor. I think its absurd, but I digress.</p>
<p>Coming back to the story,  I was concern that the waitress was being called for in alcohol abuse related mishap and she&#8217;d be handcuffed soon. She didn&#8217;t return for another 15 minutes or so. We finished our dinner, paid, and walked to see the four guys who were behind the table trying to explain away to the cop.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this crowd of four imbeciles have a history of walking out on restaurant tabs. In fact, they had done this twice at this restaurant already, and were stupid enough to try it again the third time. I guess third time&#8217;s the charm. So when these morons showed up at the restaurant that night, the manager was quick to call the cops and have the cops wait for these guys to get out. Sure enough, the guys didn&#8217;t pay, yet again, and tried to walk out only to be apprehended by the police officer. How stupid do you have to be to think you could get away with it again!</p>
<p>The second incident was even more moronic. This happened at the shopping mall (there is only one in town) on Monday, August 20th. A girl and her 8-month pregnant friend walk into a shoe store at the mall. One of the sales girl there overhears one of the girls say &#8216;distract him&#8217; to another. So now everyone in the store knows what they are up to. Sure enough, they see the shoplifting, and the salesman who was servicing the girls runs after them to stop them before they are lost in the crowd. He finds them at a clothing store and brings them back. In the mean time the mall security and the police are there to take the statement and slap a ticket for shoplifting.</p>
<p>As they interrogate the two, it comes to light that they have been to two other stores in the mall already, shoplifted there, and were trying to make a third steal (like I said, third time&#8217;s the charm). So the managers of the other two stores were called in, and while the store managers were being questioned, one of the girls (the one who was not pregnant) gives them the slip was gets away from the shoe store.</p>
<p>For starts, I cannot understand why you would try to run away from the police when they have your friend already, and will get to you one way or another. Secondly, when you get away what do you try to do? You try to get the hell outta the area. But this girl, I guess, has a blond episode, and so she goes back to the store that she shoplifted from before and tries to steal again! I guess she was trying for that third elusive strike (third time&#8217;s the charm, remember!). Well, she was caught again :)</p>
<p>In the meantime, the cops realize that she has given them the slip. They then turn the heat on the pregnant accomplice, warning her of dire consequences if she were try so much as move a finger. Until now, the plan was to give the girls a ticket &#8212; a slap on the wrist &#8212; and let them go. But now, this has become a felony, followed by obstruction of justice, and resisting arrest. This girl is in way more trouble than she realizes.</p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t get it. We you are trying to get away, you are trying to get away! Why would stop to steal some more? Especially at a store where you stole from just a few hours ago, and the manager of the store has been informed of this!</p>
<p>Like I said before, it is amazing how wrong Darwin can be sometimes. We have got to find a way to weed these stupid genes out before they annihilate our species, by having the entire human population walk over a cliff coz&#8217; they thought they&#8217;d fly if they just flapped their arms hard enough!</p>
