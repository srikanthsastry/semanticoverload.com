		<description><![CDATA[@Blue:
Actually I left out a bunch of things in favor of brevity (yeah, I know its not a very short post, but it could have been longer, much much longer).
For instance:
(1) In some restaurants, the wait-staff pool their tips and divide it equally. This often allows someone who isn&#039;t pulling their weight to get away with others&#039; share of the tips.
(2) The wait-staff often stays back for an hr after close to clean the place up, and shows up an hour early to open the place up. For all this extra time (when there are no customers around), they get paid the same $2.13 though there is not chance of tips.
(3) Since is the largest slice of their pay, sometimes wait-staff resorts to stealing other wait-staff&#039;s tip. And worse, sometimes customers steal the tips!
(4) Waitresses working graveyard shifts are often sexually harassed by (inebriated) customers, and the waitress is helpless because the customer&#039;s always right! And besides, if there is some hope of a good tip, they don&#039;t want to screw that chance up.
(5) Customers sometimes play the race card. Often happens when an African American thinks he/she is not being served well by a white waiter/waitress, and complains to the manager that he/she is being discriminated against. Often, there is little basis for the allegation, but the manager will give the meal to the customer for free, take it out of the waiter/waitress&#039;s paycheck, and chew the waiter/waitress out without really caring if it was his/her fault to begin with.
(6) Customers take 15 minutes to figure out what they want while they expect the wait-staff to wait on them at the table instead of taking care of other orders/tables. They get Irate when the wait-staff doesn&#039;t, and create a scene.... you know how this story ends.

And I could go on... this is just the tip of the iceberg really.]]></description>
