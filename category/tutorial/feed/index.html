				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the following problem(s):</p>
<ul>
<li>I had a fairly large presentation which I had to share among several people for review.</li>
<li>Not everyone was running the same version of Powerpoint, and not everyone used Windows.</li>
<li>People who wouldn&#8217;t be able to make it to my actual presentation wanted to be able to view it (along with the voice narration) later.</li>
<li>I wanted it to be accessible and usable by everyone regardless of the OS, the browser, or the presentation software they were using.</li>
</ul>
<p>I figured this was a pretty common problem that many people face and a documented solution would be nice. More so, since someone I demonstrated this solution to now swears by it and can&#8217;t thank me enough. So I figured, why not spread the knowledge :) (Unfortunately, this solution works only if you are using Windows XP/Vista. Sorry, I couldn&#8217;t find the right tools to make it work on MAC OS X.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the bird&#8217;s eye view of my solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prep your presentation to be made &#8216;complete&#8217; and &#8216;kiosk-ready&#8217;.</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.download.com/AuthorPOINT-Lite/3000-2075_4-10719205.html">Download and install AuthorPoint Lite</a>.</li>
<li> Import the presentation into AuthorPoint Lite, and preserve the rehearse timings, animations, and (optionally) narration.</li>
<li> Convert the presentation to flash using AuthorPoint Lite.</li>
<li>Upload the generated swf file online for the world to see!</li>
<li> The End.</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-150"></span></p>
<h3>Prepping your presentation</h3>
<p>Before you can make a presentation portable, you have got to make sure that the presentation itself has enough information in it to be portable. Also, you have to ensure that the presentation have been configured so that the tools you will use to make it portable can use it to advantage.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s how you would go about the job:</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ensure all information is available</span></em></p>
<p>When are making a presentation portable, then, more often than not, the people who will access it will not have the luxury of you walking through the presentation for them. So make sure you have notes for each slide for the presentation to be understandable on its own, even without the speaker present. It often a good idea to include the text of your narration for each slide in the Slide Notes section.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recording Narration</span></em></p>
<p>You also have the choice of recording your narration. You can do this if you would like people to be able to view and <em>hear</em> your presentation online. In order to record your presentation (Assuming you have a workgin microphone to record) you need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that you have no automatic animations set. You can do that as follows:
<ol>
<li> Click on the Slide Show menu and choose Custom Animation.</li>
<li>Click on the first item in the Animation Order box on the Order &amp; Timing tab.</li>
<li>Select the On Mouse Click radio button under Start Animation as shown in the figure below.<a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2008/04/custom-animation.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-151" title="Unset Custom Animation" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2008/04/custom-animation-300x208.gif" alt="Unset Custom Animation" width="300" height="208" /></a></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> Test your microphone by opening Slide Show -&gt; Record Narration -&gt; Set Microphone Level button. You’ll see the Microphone Check dialog box pop up. Set the level appropriately as shown below:<a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2008/04/test-microphone.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-152" title="Testing Microphone" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2008/04/test-microphone-300x162.gif" alt="Testing Microphone" width="300" height="162" /></a></li>
<li> You can adjust the sound quality if you like:<br />
<a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2008/04/sound-quality.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-153" title="Adjust Sound Quality" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2008/04/sound-quality-300x164.gif" alt="Adjust Sound Quality" width="300" height="164" /></a></li>
<li> DO NOT check the &#8216;Link the Narrations&#8217; checkbox! This option being unchecked is very important for portability!</li>
<li> Now start recording you narration and manually click through the slides (and animation) as you narrate into the microphone. You can stop anytime by pressing [Esc]. After you reach the last slide, or after you press [Esc], PowerPoint will ask if you&#8217;d like to save the slide timings. Click No. (As shown below):<br />
<a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2008/04/save-slide-timtings-dialong.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-154" title="Save Slide Timings Dialog" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2008/04/save-slide-timtings-dialong-300x61.gif" alt="Save Slide Timings Dialog" width="300" height="61" /></a></li>
<li> Now you can browse through the slides and review your narration by clicking on the <img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-155" title="sound icon" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2008/04/sound-icon.gif" alt="sound icon" width="30" height="30" /> icon. You can delete the narration on each slide and record the narration if necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rehearsing Timing</span></em></p>
<p>Click on the Slide Show menu and choose Rehearse Timings. You&#8217;ll immediately be transferred into Slideshow View, and the narration should begin. You’ll see a Rehearsal toolbar appear:</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2008/04/rehearse-timing.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-156" title="rehearse timing" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2008/04/rehearse-timing.gif" alt="rehearse timing" width="189" height="49" /></a></p>
<p>Advance through the presentation by advancing to the next slide when the narration for each slide is complete. Also make sure that you step through the animation appropriately. When you&#8217;ve scrolled through the entire presentation, PowerPoint will again ask if you&#8217;d like to save the timings. Click Yes.</p>
<p>Now your presentation is self-contained and complete. However, it is still a .ppt file. To make it portable, you need to convert it to a more portable format. My choice is ShockWave File, or Flash format.</p>
<h3>AuthorPoint Lite</h3>
<p><a title="AuthorPoint Lite" href="http://www.authorgen.com/authorpoint-lite-free/powerpoint-to-flash-converter.aspx">AuthorPoint Lite</a> is a free Powerpoint-to-Flash converter. The neat thing about this software is that it can import all the settings from a powerpoint slide including narration, rehearsed timing, custom animation etc. <a title="AuthorPoint Lite Review" href="http://www.freewaregenius.com/2007/08/01/authorpoint-lite/">Here is a great review on AuthorPoint Lite</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install <a title="AuthorPoint Lite" href="http://www.authorgen.com/authorpoint-lite-free/powerpoint-to-flash-converter.aspx">AuthorPoint Lite</a></li>
<li>Import your presentation into AuthorPoint Lite.</li>
<li>Save it as a swf file.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Uploading the swf file</h3>
<p>Now upload the saved swf file to your webserver, and provide a link to it on your website. This swf file is your presentation complete with your narration, animation, slide timings, your slide notes, etc. And the best part is that sinceits a swf file, any browser with a flash plugin can play this file! Truly portable!</p>
<p>Enjoy</p>
<h3>The End</h3>
<p>:)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally, over a week and a half after the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/10/free-imap-for-gmail.html">initial announcement</a>, IMAP was finally enabled on all my <a href="http://www.gmail.com">Gmail</a> accounts. Until now I used POP to access my emails from gmail, and had to use the <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#038;answer=47948">&#8216;recent:&#8217; option</a> to be able to access my emails from multiple locations. With IMAP, thankfully, that will change soon.</p>
<p>A quick intro to <a href="http://www.imap.org/">IMAP</a>. <a href="http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/005772.html">As described by Tom Spring from PC World</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<a href="http://www.imap.org/">IMAP</a> is geek speak for Internet Message Access Protocol. &#8230;.<br />
&#8230; with IMAP any changes (sorting, deleting, reading, or otherwise) are reflected across all Gmail interfaces &#8211; be it using Outlook Express, your iPhone, or Web-based Gmail. For example if you create a folder and sort messages into it using your desktop Outlook Express client those changes show up on Web-based Gmail.
 </p></blockquote>
<p>IMAP is a boon for people like me, who check their emails from multiple locations. So I decided to give IMAP support on Gmail a spin, and here&#8217;s what I came up with:</p>
<p>For starts Gmail has done a remarkable job of supporting IMAP. I can understand the technical difficulty in being able to support IMAP on Gmail. Think about it: Gmail moved away from conventional folder based email organization to offer what is essentially a tag-based (label-based) organization of email (although their tagging interface is too cumbersome in my opinion). Given that IMAP is a folder-based email access protocol, reconciling the two is not an easy task. But Google has done a good job of it this time around.</p>
<p>For starts, after you <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=77695">enable IMAP</a>, and <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=75726">configure your mail client</a> there are changes that you will notice in the web-based Gmail interface.</p>
<ul>
<li>All the folders that you create using your email client will now appear as labels in your web interface.</li>
<li>Certain labels like Trash, or Chats are reserved by gmail. If you try to create a folder by that name, then the folder will appear as &#8216;[imap]/foldername&#8217;</li>
<li>If you have any label of form &#8216;text1/text2&#8242;, they will now appear as folder &#8216;text2&#8242; being a subfolder of folder &#8216;text1&#8242;. So If you have any labels of the form &#8216;family/friend&#8217;, or &#8216;work/spam&#8217;, consider renaming them without a &#8216;/&#8217; before enabling IMAP.</li>
</ul>
<p>So how did tag-based Gmail reconcile with folder-based IMAP?</p>
<ul>
<li>Each label appears as a separate folder in IMAP. </li>
<li>To apply multiple labels, just copy the email to multiple folders. </li>
<li>Moving an email from one folder to another will change the label on the email from the first label to the other.</li>
<li>If you move an email to a sub-folder &#8216;sub&#8217; within a main folder &#8216;main&#8217;, on the web interface, it will show up as being labeled &#8216;main/sub&#8217;.</li>
<li>If you configure you mail client to sent email using gmail&#8217;s smtp server, then every copy of the email is stoed in the &#8216;[Gmail]/Sent Mail&#8217; folder.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=77657">Here</a> are the set of IMAP actions and their corresponding web based Gmail actions.</p>
<p>Spam, however, is handled differently. To mark a message as spam, just move it to the &#8216;[gmail]/spam&#8217; folder in the IMAP interface. Simply marking the email as &#8216;spam&#8217; on your mail client (like Thunderbird) will trigger the email client&#8217;s spam filters, but not Gmail&#8217;s.</p>
<h3>Drawbacks</h3>
<ul>
<li>One <del>The only</del> major drawback is that the IMAP&#8217;s default trash folder is different from Gmail&#8217;s Trash folder. There&#8217;s no easy way to fix it. <a href="http://www.techsamurai.net/entry/11/changing-thunderbirds-default-trash-folder">The only fix that I found to work for Thunderbird is here on Tech Samurai</a>. It not the most straight forward config change to make Thunderbird to GMail&#8217;s Trash folder.
</li>
<li> The bigger issue with the simulation of folder-based structure on top of tag-based structure is the following:<br />
If an email has multiple tags (labels) associated with it, then the email shows up in multiple folders on the IMAP client. &#8216;Deleting&#8217; such an email involves deleting (or moving to [Gmail]/Trash) all the virtual copies of the email from all the folders where they reside. This can be a arduous task, especially if do not know all the labels that were applied to the message to begin with (and you dont, if you are using the IMAP interface exclusively.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, a really clean and neat implementation on Google&#8217;s part. Good job Google!</p>

<p>Ever wondered if you could get a short-range wireless network (for your home) without a wireless router? Well, it is possible. Here&#8217;s how:</p>
<h3>Things you need</h3>
<ol>
<li>A home computer/laptop with an Ethernet port and wireless card (this computer will then double up as a wireless router).</li>
<li>Internet connection that terminates at your home computer/laptop</li>
<li>Client computers/laptops with wireless cards</li>
<li>Note that the instructions here are for Windows XP, other operating systems will probably have similar ways to accomplish what I am giving you instructions for.</li>
</ol>
<h3> Basic Idea </h3>
<p>The basic idea is to set up an ad hoc wireless network among all the computers/laptops so that each one can communicate with the other through the wireless network. Now designate one of the computers as a gateway. The gateway computer is connected to the internet its wired Ethernet connection. Get the gateway to advertise itself as the default internet gateway to all other computer in the ad-hoc network. Now all the computers will start accessing the internet through the gateway computer. Thus the wireless network is established.<br />
Something like this:<br />
<img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/semanticoverload/adhoc%20wireless/AdhocWirelesssetup.jpg" height="450" alt="Home Wireless Network without a wireless router" /></p>
<h3> Detailed Instructions</h3>
<p><span id="more-128"></span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Configuring your wireless card on the gateway computer</strong></li>
<p>     Your gateway computer is already connected to the internet using a wired connection. We configure the wireless card on the gateway computer as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <strong>control panel</strong>, switch to <strong>classic view</strong> and click on <strong>Network Connections</strong>. This should take you to the list of network adapters on your system. Right-click on your <strong>wireless network connection</strong> and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li> Click on <strong>Wireless Networks</strong> tab in the properties window, and it should look something like this:</li>
<p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/semanticoverload/adhoc%20wireless/Wirelessprops.jpg" alt="Wireless Networks tab of wireless card" /></p>
<li> In this tab, click on the <strong>Advanced</strong> button right next to &#8216;<em>Learn about setting up a wireless network configuration</em>&#8216;. You should see a window that looks like this:</li>
<p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/semanticoverload/adhoc%20wireless/wirelessadhoconly.jpg" alt="Advaced configuration of wireless networks" /></p>
<li>Click on <strong>Computer-to-computer (Ad Hoc) networks only</strong>, and then click <strong>Close</strong>.</li>
<li>You should now be back in the <strong>Wireless Networks</strong> tab of the wireless card <strong>properties</strong> window. Click on <strong>Add</strong> button (to add a new ad hoc network). You should see a window that looks something like this:</li>
<p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/semanticoverload/adhoc%20wireless/wirelesscreateadhocAP.jpg" alt="Adding a new ad hoc network" /></p>
<li>Give you ad hoc network the name that you want. I called it &#8216;Peggy Sue&#8217; in my example. Let the <strong>Network Authentication</strong> be &#8216;<em>open</em>&#8216;. You can configure authentication later, if you want. Then, click <strong>Ok</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<li>Configuring the Wired connection on the gateway computer</li>
<p>             Now you have a ad hoc wireless network, and a connection to the internet. You have to configure them to talk to each other other so that traffic from the ad hoc wireless network can access the internet. You do so by &#8216;sharing&#8217; the internet connection as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <strong>control panel</strong>, switch to <strong>classic view</strong> and click on <strong>Network Connections</strong>. This should take you to the list of network adapters on your system. Right-click on your <strong>local area connection</strong> and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>Go to the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab which looks something like this:</li>
<p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/semanticoverload/adhoc%20wireless/wirelessshareadhocconnection.jpg" alt="Advanced properties of the LAN connection" /></p>
<li>Check the box that says &#8216;<em>Allow other network users to connect through this computer&#8217;s internet connection</em>&#8216;. And click <strong>Ok</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now when you right-click on the <strong>wireless network connection</strong> and click on <strong>view wireless networks</strong>, you should see something like this:<br />
<img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/semanticoverload/adhoc%20wireless/wirelessadhoccreated.jpg" alt="list of wireless networks including Peggy Sue" /></p>
<li> Connecting other wireless clients to the network</li>
<p>All you now have to do is start up other computers, and connect to the ad hoc wireless network (Peggy Sue) that you just created and you should be good to browse the internet wirelessly!</p>
</ol>
