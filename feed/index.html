				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anna Hazare&#8217;s fast unto death has <a href="http://ibnlive.in.com/news/govt-in-dilemma-as-annas-fast-enters-third-day/148481-3.html">entered its third day</a>, and I am still conflicted about whether the <a title="Wikipedia article on Jan Lokpal bill" href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Lokpal_Bill">Jan Lokpal Bill</a> (in support of which Hazare has launched his fast) will actually address the problem of rampant corruption in India.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 560px"><img title="Lokpal Bill" src="http://www.indiatogether.org/legislation/images/2005/law-lokpal.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="275" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image source: indiatogether.org</p></div>
<p>To be clear, the <a title="Government's lokpal bill" href="http://indiaagainstcorruption.org/docs/Govt._s_Lokpal_Bill_2010.zip">Lokpal Bill (Ombudsman Bill) proposed by the lawmakers</a> in India as a mechanism to fight corruption is a sham and is designed to encourage, rather than discourage corruption. In the lawmaker&#8217;s version of the Lokpal bill, the office of the ombudsperson is appointed by the government (at its own pleasure) and the office will serve only in an advisory capacity with no powers to actually pursue corruption charges in court. Furthermore, the jurisdiction of the office will be limited to politicians and not the civil servant and other officers who are responsible for running the government machinery; of course, the office will not have the authority to investigate the Prime Minister. Also, while the office of the ombudsperson do not have the authority to actually press charges against the politicians they deem corrupt, they do have the authority to penalize the citizens who make the corruption accusation (in the event that the office finds their target of investigation innocent). [source: <a href="http://indiaagainstcorruption.org/">India Against Corruption</a>]</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t take a genius to figure out that this bill is a toothless tiger which will only foster the moral bankruptcy and the rampant corruption that is the Indian government.</p>
<p>Now, we come to the Jan Lokpal bill that is being proposed by the <a href="http://indiaagainstcorruption.org/">India Against Corruption</a> lobby. The Jan Lokpal bill proposes that the office of the ombudsperson be an independent institution much like the supreme court or the election commission. It is to be appointed by a selection committee consisting of judges, &#8216;meritorious&#8217; citizens who have won awards like the Nobel prize, Magsasay award, the Election Commission, Auditor General, and others. The bill proposes that central vigilance commission (which investigates corruption by the civil servants and government offices and departments) and the division of the Central Bureau of Investigation be folded into the office of the ombudsperson, so that there is a single office that investigates the charges of corruption in all branches and levels of the government. The bill also proposes that the office be an investigatory body with authority for law enforcement which allows the office to pursue criminal charges against the individuals who the office finds guilty. The bill also sets a time limit of one year to complete the investigation and one year for filing charges against the accused if sufficient evidence is available. The bill also have provisions for whistle blower protection, and a provision to recover the money or value lost by the government from the individual who was found guilty of corruption (which resulted in the aforementioned loss). [source: <a href="http://indiaagainstcorruption.org/">India Against Corruption</a>]</p>
<p>On the face of it, the Jan Lokpal bill looks like a great idea, but reflecting on it, I am disturbed by the assumptions made in the bill. My objections are a little different from the kind I have seen online. For example, here are objections by [<a title="Objections to Jan Lokpal Bill by Rohan" href="http://hopelesslyflawed.wordpress.com/2011/04/07/the-lokpal-bill/">Rohan</a>], [<a href="http://blog.offstumped.in/2011/04/05/anna-hazares-misguided-fast/">Offstumped</a>], and [<a href="http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/the-hazare-hazard-/431045/">Business Standard</a>]. I have both practical and philosophical objections. I present one of each.</p>
<p>On a practical level, the bill says little to address the issue of &#8220;who watches the watchman&#8221;. How do you ensure that the integrity of the ombudsperson&#8217;s office is not compromised, and if it is compromised, then how do you recognize and then fix it? Given the level of corruption in India, this is a real concern. Until this issue is addressed sufficiently, I am not too comfortable throwing my support behind it.</p>
<p>On a philosophical level, I have deeper concerns. The office proposed by the Jan Lokpal bill is a meritocratic institution which monitors a the government, a democratic institution. To put it differently, the bill makes a democratic institution accountable not to the people who voted, but to a meritocratic institution which can potentially exert it&#8217;s influence on the outcomes of the governance. The risk here is that such a meritocratic institution could develop the attitude of &#8220;people don&#8217;t know what they want, but we know what&#8217;s good for the people&#8221;, and use it&#8217;s authority to enforce an agenda that might not be the will of the people.</p>
<p>While I grant you that the current &#8220;democracy&#8221; in the India is really plutocracy in disguise, simply making it answerable to a meritocracy cannot be a solution to the problem at hand.</p>
<p>IMHO, the solution to this problem of corruption can only come from democracy itself. Not because democracy is somehow sacred, but because the institution that is corrupt is supposed to be democratic in the first place. Initiatives like &#8220;<a href="http://www.ipaidabribe.com/">I Paid A Bribe</a>&#8221; is a great example of such efforts. Another example of involving the citizenry was proposed by India&#8217;s chief economic advisor Kaushik Babu in which he proposed<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2011/03/30/kaushik-basu-says-make-bribe-giving-legal/"> decriminalizing bribe giving</a> and keep bribe-taking a crime. This will provide an incentive for the bribe giver to not conceal the fact that the bribe was given and even co-operate to ensure that the bribe taker is caught.<br />
I wish I had something more constructive to offer, but unfortunately I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://realitycheck.wordpress.com/2011/04/06/jan-lok-pal-caveat-emptor/">Realitycheck provides credible objections</a> to the Jan Lokpal bill..</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looks like Afridi&#8217;s comments (similar to the ones I talked about in<a title="Afridi’s Turncoat Act" href="../2011/04/04/afridis-turncoat-act/index.html"> my previous post</a>) are raising quite a storm in India and elsewhere, especially in the online community. He said something to the effect that Indians do not have as large a heart as Pakistanis and Muslims do. Since the proverbial <a title="TOI article: Muslim scholar slams Afridi's line" href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Muslim-scholars-slam-Afridis-line/articleshow/7879040.cms">fit hit the shan</a>, Afridi has gone into damage control mode claiming that<a title="Video: NDTV interview with Afridi" href="http://profit.ndtv.com/video/show/195596"> he was quoted out of context</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_829" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 209px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2011/04/5285420332_4fc0a23931.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-829 " title="Shahid Afridi" src="../wp-content/uploads/2011/04/5285420332_4fc0a23931.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Afridi. Image source: http://www.flickr.com/photos/charaka/</p></div>
<p>The fury that came out of the Indian online community either in support of or against Afridi had the usual <a title="Aman Ki Asha" href="http://www.amankiasha.com/">Aman-ki-Asha</a> defense or <a title="Wikipedia article on State Sponsored Terrorism and Pakistan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-sponsored_terrorism#Pakistan">Pakistan-is-a-terror-supporter</a> attack. I will not comment on either side of the arguments except that I saw many good arguments on both sides. However, I do wish to make a point about &#8220;Pakistan is a terrorist state&#8221; versus &#8220;Pakistanis are terrorist sympathizers&#8221; argument that seems to have conveniently folded itself into the argument associated with Afridi&#8217;s statements.﻿</p>
<p>On one side, while many agree that the political establishment in Pakistan sympathizes with and actively supports terrorist acts against India, they caution that one should not claim that the state&#8217;s support for terrorism is the same as the people&#8217;s support for terrorism much like Muage vs. Zimbabweans. On the other side, there are many who argue that a state establishment cannot function without an approval from the masses (even a tacit approval through silence is sufficient). In the latter camp, <a title="Greatbong's blogpost about Afridi's comments" href="http://greatbong.net/2011/04/05/the-big-hearts/">Greatbong argues</a> that <a title="Salmaan Taseer assassaination" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmaan_Taseer#Assassin">assassination of moderates like Taseer</a> points to a popular sympathy (albeit a tacit one) for Islamic fundamentalism.</p>
<p>I agree with the sentiment that one should not equate the actions of the political establishment with the people of the state. This statement is easy to defend when talking about the people of the state, but the same arguments do not hold when you are considering individuals. The difference is the similar to how statistical inferences, while applicable to a large dataset, become irrelevant when considering the outcome of a single event. Let me explain. While the American public may not favor massive human rights violations in Iraq and may even be against the war in Iraq, you cannot claim the same to be true of some American individual. I know many Americans who actively support America&#8217;s invasion of Iraq and deposing of Saddam Hussain. I also know many Americans who oppose it.</p>
<p>The American I know who oppose the Iraq war are quick to blame their political establishment and, if pressed, are willing to offer their apologies to Iraqies and an outright admission that they oppose their goverment&#8217;s actions.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go back and consider Afridi&#8217;s comments specifically with respect to this argument &#8221;Pakistan is a terrorist state&#8221; versus &#8220;Pakistanis are terrorist sympathizers&#8221;. Reacting to Gautam Gambhir&#8217;s statement that India&#8217;s victory over Pakistan will help soothe the pain over 26/11 Mumbai attacks, Afridi said: &#8220;I think they were very stupid comments by Gautam Gambhir. I was not expecting this from Gautam. This is all politics, what do you know about who carried out the Mumbai attacks?&#8221; [<a href="http://www.indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/134319/sports/world-cup-afridi-slams-gambhir-for-2611-remark.html">source</a>]</p>
<p>Despite <a title="ISI's role in 26/11 attacks" href="http://www.lankaenews.com/English/news.php?id=10836">overwhelming</a> <a title="Headly reveals Pak role in 26/11 Mumbai attacks" href="http://ibnlive.in.com/news/david-headley-reveals-paks-role-in-2611-attacks/133350-3.html?from=tn">evidence</a> that <a title="Wikipedia article on attribution of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_of_the_2008_Mumbai_attacks">26/11 attacks received support from Pakistani establishment</a>, Afridi asserts that there is no knowledge of the perpetrators of 26/11. He could have distanced himself from the whole thing by simply saying &#8220;This is just politics.&#8221; and stopping there. But he did not. For some reason he felt compelled to defend the Pakistani establishment. That sounds like Afridi is batting for the Pakistani establishment. So I cannot give Afridi a reprieve on the &#8221;Pakistan is a terrorist state&#8221; versus &#8220;Pakistanis are terrorist sympathizers&#8221; schism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Pakistan cricket team returned home after their semi-final loss to India, the media mobbed skipper Shahid Afridi and asked him about the loss to India. In response, Afridi got pretty aggressive and asked the media (and I am paraphrasing here) &#8220;Why are you against India? Why the hatred? Our rituals are borrowed from India; our culture is in large part from there; the movies we watch in our homes are Indian. So why such animosity?&#8221;<br />
Here is the video [the interview is in Urdu]:</p>
<p><span class="youtube">
<object width="425" height="355">
<param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/tv749SCqzuU?color1=d6d6d6&amp;color2=f0f0f0&amp;border=0&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showsearch=0&amp;rel=1" />
<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />
<embed wmode="opaque" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/tv749SCqzuU?color1=d6d6d6&amp;color2=f0f0f0&amp;border=0&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showsearch=0&amp;rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed>
<param name="wmode" value="opaque" />
</object>
</span><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv749SCqzuU">www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv749SCqzuU</a></p></p>
<p>Afridi&#8217;s response made it to Facebook and other social media sites and was appreciated by many as a mature and responsible response by a de-fact ambassador of Pakistan and cricket.<br />
The very next day, Afridi is interviewed by a reporter from Dawn news and he says this: &#8220;The media in India is very negative. One of the reasons India and Pakistan do not get along well is because of the media there. [...] I tried a lot to reach out to the Indian players, but no matter how hard we try they can never be like us.&#8221;<br />
Here is the video [the interview is in Urdu]:</p>
<p><span class="youtube">
<object width="425" height="355">
<param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/HXh8Wk9LkqU?color1=d6d6d6&amp;color2=f0f0f0&amp;border=0&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showsearch=0&amp;rel=1" />
<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />
<embed wmode="opaque" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/HXh8Wk9LkqU?color1=d6d6d6&amp;color2=f0f0f0&amp;border=0&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showsearch=0&amp;rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed>
<param name="wmode" value="opaque" />
</object>
</span><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXh8Wk9LkqU">www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXh8Wk9LkqU</a></p></p>
<p>So in 24 hours, Afridi goes from chastising Pakistani media for all the hyperbole and starts blaming Indian media and the Indian team for the less than cordial atmosphere between the two nation.</p>
<p>Wonder what prompted the turncoat act. Any theories?</p>
<p>P.S: Note that Afridi avoids eye contact rather conspicuously in the second video and not the first.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is a coalescence of a discussion I had with my friend<a href="http://usclancaster.sc.edu/faculty/lawrence/"> Nick</a> over Facebook status updates. I thought it worthwhile to share the outcome of the discussion.</p>
<p>Recently, Jon Stewart did his piece <a title="The Daily Show segment &quot;I give up&quot; that aired on March 28th 2011" href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-march-28-2011/i-give-up---pay-anything---">&#8220;I give up&#8221;</a> on the fact that while the conservative political machine has been painting the public workers (like teachers and firemen) as the greedy ones who are bleeding the nation dry, in reality it is corporations like GE who are the problem because despite a $9B profit, <a title="News article that says GE paid no income taxes for 2010 despite making over $9B in profits" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/general-electric-paid-federal-taxes-2010/story?id=13224558">GE paid $0 federal income tax</a> and got a $3.2B tax benefit. Now, it is considered common or &#8216;folk&#8217; knowledge that corporations exploit all kinds of tax loopholes and lobby heavily to ensure that tax laws leave open several such loopholes to be exploited by these corporations. So why are Stewart and other so-called pundits (including news organizations) &#8216;noticing&#8217; this only now and then pretending to be salient critics of such incongruities while at the same time depending on, and profiting from, the very same incongruities.  This is a real conflict of interest! One that hasn&#8217;t been adequately explained. My discussion on Facebook yielded the following.</p>
<p>Acting as an apologist for Stewart and co, it may be argued that while they do not contribute anything for affecting a change or reform, at least they enlighten us on how we are being screwed over. Many times we already know of it, and at other times it is news. But through it all, at least we are laughing. Then again, isn&#8217;t it a little bit like <a title="IMDB page for Elle Driver" href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001804/bio">Elle Driver</a> reading to <a title="Blurb on the character Budd Sidewinder on wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kill_Bill_characters#Budd_.2F_Sidewinder">Budd &#8220;Sidewinder&#8221;</a> about the effects of the venom of a Black Mamba, in <a title="IMDB page for Kill Bill Vol. 2" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194/">Kill Bill Vol. 2</a>, after the Black Mamba has bitten him?</p>
<p>Consider the following hypothesis: This country has been and continues to be run by corporations. The political parties and the politicians are simply the means by which the corporations accomplish this task. There is little by means of democracy or &#8220;the system&#8221; that can be done to change this fact. So the only way out is perhaps a revolution. And the existing power brokers want to ensure that it never happens. They do this by drugging the entire population, intellectually speaking, of course.</p>
<p>The population in question can be broadly classified as the &#8220;vulgar&#8221; (and by vulgar I mean <a title="Dictionary entry for 'vulgar'" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/vulgar">&#8220;Of or associated with the great masses of people&#8221;</a>) or the &#8220;<a title="Dictionary entry for 'intelligentsia'" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a>&#8220;. The vulgar have the numbers and the ability to affect such a revolution, but they lack the knowledge and understanding to accomplish this; the intelligentsia, on the other hand, have the knowledge and the intellect to use the abilities of the vulgar to affect the revolution. So together, the population can make the change. But they will not, by design. And here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p>Glenn Beck, Bill O&#8217;Reilly, and others serve as the &#8221;opiate of the vulgar&#8221; in ensuring that the masses focus their frustrations, anger, and action against all the wrong issues and attribute the problems to all the wrong reasons. Simultaneously, Stewart, Colbert, and others serve as the &#8220;opiate of the intelligentsia&#8221; by convincing their audience to simply resign to the status quo and not advocate for any change. Between the two, the existing power structures ensure perpetuation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had an enjoyable evening yesterday all thanks to a fabulous performance by Gioia De Cari  <em><a title="Link to Unexpected Theatre" href="http://www.unexpectedtheatre.org/about">Truth Values</a>: One Girl&#8217;s Romp Through M.I.T.&#8217;s Male Math Maze</em>. It is an autobiographical account of Gioia&#8217;s years as a doctoral student in the<a title="Math Dept. at MIT" href="http://math.mit.edu/"> Math department at MIT</a>. The performance was a part of <a title="MIT 150" href="http://mit150.mit.edu/">MIT&#8217;s 150th anniversary</a> celebration.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 360px"><img title="Gioia De Cari in &quot;Truth Values&quot;" src="http://unexpectedtheatre.org/Images/Small_about_photo.jpg" alt="Gioia De Cari in &quot;Truth Values&quot;" width="350" height="205" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Gioia De Cari in &quot;Truth Values&quot;</p></div>
<p>Gioia is a self described &#8220;recovering mathematician&#8221; who has a great gift for writing, acting, and singing. (Oh, did I happen to mention <a title="Olsen and De Cari's website" href="http://www.olsondecariduo.com/">she is a soprano</a>?) Her play was unexpectedly funny and enjoyable. When I first received an email about it, I expected a litany of complaints about how hard it is for a woman to make it in math and science (largely male-dominated fields). But it wasn&#8217;t and yet it was, at the same time. It is said, &#8220;there is no story so good that it can&#8217;t be spoiled in the telling&#8221;. With Gioia, she had a fantastic story and told in the best manner possible, as a monologue/mono-act by the author/actress herself. It was funny, and it was sad, and best of all, no matter who you are, you couldn&#8217;t help but empathize with her. It offered a scathing and insightful look at an academic (sub)culture that was born out of the incidental male-dominance in mathematics (and sciences) and continues to serve as a deterrent for women to succeed in these fields. But Gioia wasn&#8217;t complaining, she was just holding up a mirror; and to ensure that the walls of prejudice do not block the message, she gift wrapped it with some irrepressible humor which was a treat to watch.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Gioia wrote the play as a response to former Harvard President <a title="Wikipedia page about Lawrence Summers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers">Lawrence Summers</a>’ (yes, the same Larry Summers who <a title="Full transcript of Obama's appearance on the daily Show in 2010" href="http://lincmad.blogspot.com/2010/10/full-transcript-of-obama-on-daily-show.html">Obama said &#8220;did a heckuva job&#8221;</a> on the Daily Show) statement that women are less represented than men in the sciences because there is a &#8221;greater variance in intelligence among men than women, and that this difference in variance might be intrinsic.&#8221; [<a title="Boston Globe article on Larry Summers' statement about &quot;intrinsic difference between the genders&quot;" href="http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2005/01/17/summers_remarks_on_women_draw_fire/">source</a>] Not surprisingly, that controversy contributed to <a title="Article discussing Summers' resignation as Harvard President" href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2006/2/22/summers-resigns-shortest-term-since-civil/">his resignation</a> the following year.</p>
<p>The performance schedule for Truth Values is available <a title="Performance Schedule of Truth Values" href="http://www.unexpectedtheatre.org/performance_schedule">here</a>. If you get a chance to attend it, then do not miss out! I promise you that you will not be disappointed.</p>
<p>I close this post with a video by Gioia discussing her play:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As early as 2006, the US military started falling short on it&#8217;s recruitment numbers, but they made the<a title="US military recruiting and retention website" href="http://www.army.mil/recruitingandretention/"> target recruitment numbers and more</a>. Obviously, with two wars to participate in, meeting this goal was imperative. But in doing so, they had to cut corners. The military started <a title="NY Times 2007 article on military recruitment of ex-cons" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/14/us/14military.html">recruiting people with criminal backgrounds</a> including murderers by issuing the so-called &#8220;<a title="Wikipedia article on moral waivers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_waiver">moral waivers</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>The reaction to such recruitment has ranged from <a title="2006 article on SFgate.com decrying recruitment of felons in the military" href="http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-10-01/opinion/17315471_1_recruits-criminal-records-military">outrage</a> to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/21/AR2008042103295.html">ambivalence</a> to <a href="http://www.statenews.com/index.php/article/2008/04/recruiting_felons_for_military_risky_unavoidable">resignation</a>. But the effect of recruiting felons into the military has not been sufficiently illuminated. The military has been <a title="Julian Assange of wikileaks urges the US to investigate abuse by their soldiers" href="http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2010/11/04-5">accused of hiding</a> any moral or pragmatic ill effects that may have been precipitated by such large numbers of felons in the military. Incidentally, the evidence of such <a title="wikileaks war logs" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/22/wikileaks-iraq-war-logs-i_n_772658.html">ill effects</a> and <a title="US military issues secret orders to ignore abuse by soldiers" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-detainee-abuse-torture-saddam">complacency of the military</a> have traditionally been <a title="Iraqi inmate's account of abuse by US soldiers" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/05/world/the-struggle-for-iraq-inmate-iraqi-recounts-hours-of-abuse-by-us-troops.html">anecdotal</a>.</p>
<p>We may finally be seeing the effect of such &#8220;moral waivers&#8221;. Recently, a court martial in Washington <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/asia/US-Soldier-Sentenced-to-24-Years-in-Prison-in-Afghan-Murder-Case2-118577784.html">sentenced a US soldier to 24 years</a> in prison for murdering Afghan civilians with intent.It looks like unlike with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse">Abu Gharib</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_D._Steele#Iron_Triangle_Murders">Iron Triangle murders</a>, the US military has stopped protecting soldiers who commit crimes (while in active duty). While there is no evidence to say that the soldier was a &#8220;moral waiver&#8221; recruit, I don&#8217;t think that matters. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stjepan_Me%C5%A1trovi%C4%87">Dr. Stjepan Mestrovic</a> argues in his book <em><a title="Publisher's site for Rules of Engagement" href="http://www.algora.com/256/book/details.html">Rules of Engagement</a></em>, certain events, behavior, or tolerance creates a social atmosphere which affects the moral compass to the individuals in that society so that acts that would otherwise been considered immoral or wrong suddenly becomes acceptable, is rationalized, and condoned. The murder of Afghan civilians by US soldiers could well point to the creation of such an unhealthy social environment that has metastasized the soldiers&#8217; moral inclinations and driven them to misanthropic acts that have occurred almost beyond the individual&#8217;s volition.</p>
<p>I hope I am wrong. But I seriously doubt it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US has started its <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/lt_libya_obama">military offensive against Libya</a>. Incidentally, the latter is an oil rich country ruled by a dictator who is not America&#8217;s puppet. Sound familiar? Hint: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War">1991</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War">2003</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, the whole offensive has <a href="http://www.dailypolitical.com/politics/republicans-say-president-waited-too-long-taking-action-against-libya.htm">bipartisan support</a>. So it&#8217;s fair to say that there are very few within the government (including the opposition party of &#8216;no&#8217;) who do not support the action. The major reason for this offensive is that Gaddafi did not heed to the demands of the international community which were [<a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/03/19/134682336/U-S-Allies-Discuss-Military-Action-Against-Libya">source</a>]:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gadhafi must stop his troops from advancing on Benghazi, pull them back from Ajdabiya, Misurata, and Zawiyah, and establish water, electricity and gas supplies to all areas. Humanitarian assistance must be allowed to reach the people of Libya. Let me be clear, these terms are not negotiable.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fear is that if the unrest in Libya is left unchecked, then the entire nation will descend into a civil war and there will be human-rights violation which is something the US is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/19/human-rights-activists-protest-abuse-bradley-manning_n_838006.html">very</a> <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/category/topic/counterterrorism/guantanamo">protective</a> of. Interestingly, doesn&#8217;t that argument make a stronger case for intervention in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Darfur">Darfur, Sudan</a>? Of course it does! Then I wonder why the US refuses to intervene in what is arguably the worst abuses of human rights since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot">Pol Pot&#8217;s regime</a>.</p>
<p>We all know what&#8217;s going on. Libya has oil and Gaddafi is not a US puppet. Currently Gaddafi is struggling to maintain complete control over Libya. So US has both the motive and the opportunity to change the status quo. To place a figurehead in an oil-rich country so as to serve US interests. Lately, the US is being increasingly candid about its intentions. I suppose it is a good thing in some ways. For example, the US intentions are now <a href="http://www.gametheory.net/dictionary/CommonKnowledge.html">common knowledge</a>, instead of being <a href="http://www.gametheory.net/dictionary/CommonKnowledge.html">mutual knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>The most blatant admission of America&#8217;s abandonment a moral compass came from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> Admiral <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Mullen">Mullen</a>. Given that the rulers in  Bahrain and Yemen have used force against anti-government demonstrators, and yet, the US has intervened only Libya and not Bahrain or Yemen, Admiral Mullen argued [<a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/150881-mullen-we-have-treat-every-country-differenty">source</a>]:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t had a relationship with Libya for a long, long time. The Bahrainis and that country has been a critical ally for decades. So we&#8217;re working very hard to support a peaceful resolution there, as tragic as it has been, and we certainly decry the violence which has occurred in Bahrain. I just think the approach there needs to be different&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: We don&#8217;t like Gaddafi, and so it&#8217;s ok to attack Libya under this pretext. We like the rulers of Bahrain and Yemen. They serve US interests. So we don&#8217;t care enough to ensure that the citizens of those countries actually enjoy any of the freedoms that we constantly exalt. All that matters is that US is better off in the end. Everything else is just a puppet show anyway.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just following up on my <a title="Tweet about lost dog I found in Bryan" href="http://twitter.com/chrosyn/statuses/25082640972">earlier tweet about the lost dog</a>.</p>
<p>I found a dog lost and confused between Lynn Dr. and Sulphur Springs Rd. on South College Ave. in Bryan [<a title="Google Maps link with a marker for the location where I found the dog." href="http://maps.google.com/maps?z=16&amp;q=30.637433,-96.356525%28Found%20dog%29">Google Maps link</a>] at around 9:45 PM in the evening. I saw it as I was driving to KEOS. It was sitting in the middle of the road and all traffic was going around her. I pulled over and tried to get it to move to the side. It was dazed and very afraid. At first it started moving away from me in fear, but I managed to get her out of the street. She is obviously someone&#8217;s pet since she has a collar.</p>
<p>I called Brazos police who then transferred to me Brazos animal control. To make a long story short, I have dropped it off at the fenced side yard at Brazos Animal Shelter. Everyone in Bryan/College Station area please spread the word so that the owner may collect the dog. I fear that if the owner does not claim her in three days, she might be put down (Brazos animal shelter it not a no-kill shelter; they kill animals that they deemed not likely to be adopted).</p>

<p>Here are a few pictures of the dog to help the owner identify it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a really nice and friendly dog. I&#8217;ll be really sad if it is put down. Please share this post on Facebook/Twitter/MySpace/listserv/email or any other means to get the owner to see it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My earlier post on the similarity in the stories of <a href="../2010/08/31/orpheus-and-adi-shankara/index.html">Orpheus and Adi Shankara</a> inspired me to look for more, and naturally, I found many. I might, perhaps, write them all down some day. For now, here&#8217;s another one. This time it is between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Job">Book of Job</a> (from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markandeya_Purana">Markandeya Purana</a> (a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_scripture">Hindu text</a>).</p>
<p>The book of Job is about Job&#8217;s trials at the hands of Satan. Here is a paraphrased version of the story: Job is a pious man. Satan approaches God and says that Job is so pious mostly because God has kept him fairly well off. If God were to take away all of Job&#8217;s possessions, then Job would fail is his duties as a pious man. God accepts this challenge and takes all possessions away from Job. Despite this, Job remains pious. As his misfortunes pile up, Job finally caves in and questions God about this &#8216;injustice&#8217;. In response, God emphasizes his sovereignty in creating and maintaining the world. Finally, humbled by God&#8217;s chastising, Job turns speechless, giving up and repenting his previous requests of justice. To this, Job is restored to health, gaining double the riches he possessed before and having new children.</p>
<p>This is a typical story of a righteous sufferer. As you have probably guessed, there is a remarkably similar story in Markandeya Purana: the story of King <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harishchandra">Harishchandra</a>. Similar to Job, King Harishchandra is an extremely righteous king who never goes back on his word and never lies. For various reasons (the reasons change with every retelling of the story) sage <a title="Vishwamitra" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishwamitra">Vishwamitra</a>, once approached Harishchandra and informed him of a promise made by the king to donate his entire kingdom. True to his word, Harishchandra did so. The sage, proclaimed that for an act of donation to be completed, an additional amount as <em>Dakshina (honorarium)</em> had to be paid. Harishchandra, with no money in his hands, had to sell his wife and son. Eventually, he had to sell himself to a guard at a cremation ground.</p>
<p>The king, his wife, and son endured tremendous hardships. Thanks to an unfortunate sequence of events, the son dies, and his wife brings the son&#8217;s body to the cremation ground for the last rites. She is so poor that she could not even pay the taxes needed to cremate him. Even though Harishchandra realizes that his son is dead, his wife is begging him to help perform the last rites, and he is overcome is grief, he does not waver from his <em>dharma (duty)</em>. He asks for the sacred wedding necklace around his wife&#8217;s neck as payment of the tax. She willingly rests her head on a stone slab and asks Harishchandra to chop her head off for the necklace (the only way a woman may take her wedding necklace off while her husband is alive is in death). As he gets ready to chop her head the Gods appear and inform him that his righteousness was being tested. His son, wife, and kingdom is restored to him.</p>
<p>Theological import and motivations for these two myths aside, I am interested in how they came to be so similar. Like with the <a href="../2010/08/31/orpheus-and-adi-shankara/index.html">case of Orpheus and Adi Shankara</a>, there are too many similar elements (riches to rags, death of progeny, survival of the spouse, and so on). So I wager that this is no coincidence.</p>
<p>Let us take a closer look at the earliest known dates for these myths. The earliest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Job#Origin_and_textual_history">textual origins for the Book of Job is placed in 4th century BCE</a>. Whereas, the origins of Markandeya Purana is unknown, the earliest known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puranas#Origins">written form is placed in 3rd century CE</a>. Naturally, it is entirely possible that the puranas were an established oral tradition prior to this date. Besides, this still doesn&#8217;t provide us with a connection between the two myths.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: what follows next is entirely my hypothesis without scholarly research. Feel free to debase and/or ignore my speculations.</p>
<p>Looking at the geography between the Middle East and India, we see that the Persian empire occupied most of the space. Interestingly, there is a long history of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Jews_in_Iran">Judaism in Persia</a>. The 4th century BCE (the period attributed to the written origins of the Book of Job) saw huge political turmoil in Persia thanks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander the Great</a>. His empire reached into the greater India region. Given that some <a title="NHY Times article on kissing" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/14/opinion/14foer.html">anthropologists hypothesize that Alexander&#8217;s troops learned kissing from India and too it back to Greece</a>. It is not at all inconceivable that the story of a righteous sufferer traveled between the Jews in Persia and the Vedic/proto-Hindu people in India.</p>
<p>The question that still remains is which way did it travel? From India to Persia, or the other way around? If anyone has any hypothesis, clues, arguments, I would love to hear them. As of now, my speculation stops here.</p>
<p>UPDATE: The Book of Job seems to have been pre-dated by an ancient Sumerian text &#8220;<a href="http://www-etcsl.orient.ox.ac.uk/section5/tr524.htm">A man and his god</a>&#8220;. This gives us a good idea of the direction in which the story may have travelled, but that doesn&#8217;t explain the how the exegeses travelled. I have a hard time believing that the Jews came up with it all on their own simply because there aren&#8217;t many philosophical treatises written by the ancient Jewish people. The Greek and Indians, on the other hand, were a whole another story. My bet is that the exposition and exegeses associated with the Book of Job either came from Greece with Alexander the Great, or the story first travelled to India, and the philosophers in India gave it the philosophical mortar and this travelled back the Persia via Alexander&#8217;s army and made it back to the Jewish people.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The notion of international conferences are a commonplace anymore. But such was not the case over 150 years ago. The first international scientific conference was held on Sept. 3rd, 1860. Sarah Everts marks the 150 years of science as international discipline with this <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/cen/science/88/8836sci1.html">fascinating article in C&amp;E News</a>.</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>When the 1860 conference began, chemistry was in a total state of  disarray. Although most chemists believed in atoms and molecules, nobody  could agree on molecular formulas. Even simple molecules such as water  were hotly debated: Most leading chemists at the time claimed that  water’s molecular formula was OH, and a minority argued that it was H<sub>2</sub>O.  More complex molecules were an even bigger battleground: At least 19  different representations of acetic acid were being used in textbooks of  that era.</p></blockquote>
<p>The motivation for the conference is obvious. Read the <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/cen/science/88/8836sci1.html">entire article</a> to understand its significance.</p>
