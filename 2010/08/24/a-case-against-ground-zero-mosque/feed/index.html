		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s not my point at all. I am not against building a mosque any more than I am against building a church there. But one cannot ignore the catch-22 situation US could potentially find itself with this issue. 
I agree with you that the Right&#039;s opposition is ludicrous, and they have no business making such noise. I also agree that the right build Park51 is indisputable. However, given the Right&#039;s predictable Islamophobia and predictable response, on what basis can it be claimed that it is unreasonable to wonder if it was a deliberate ploy by radical Islamic organizations to use the Right as a pawn and place US in this political lose-lose situation?

 I have a hard time believing that &quot;they had no idea there would be opposition to it&quot;. I content that backers of Park51 were aware of possible backlash and went ahead with it. Now as for the intent of doing that might well be benign. But if it is not, and I do not claim that it is not, then one must admit that it indeed is a good politics.]]></description>
