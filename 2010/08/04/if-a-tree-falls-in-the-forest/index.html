<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/08/privacy.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-572" title="privacy" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/08/privacy.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a><em>&#8220;If a tree falls in the forest and there is no one to hear it, does it still make a sound?&#8221;</em> This, in essence, is the issue of privacy. If a specific action (or information) is unobservable (even after the fact) by no one else but the actor, then that act (or information) is, by definition, private. The actor could potentially by a single individual or a cohort. Now, because we are in the so-called &#8220;information age&#8221;, increasingly greater portions of our actions and our information are becoming observable. Unfortunately, very few of us realize this, and so many actions that we thought were private, are not so, and this getting a lot of people into hot water. Naturally, there is a backlash, and resulting turbulence is now presenting itself in all its glory all over the Internet.</p>
<p>Even though there is a lot of noise about privacy issues, there isn&#8217;t really anyone with a clear picture on where things are, where they will be heading, where they should be heading, and how do we as individuals adapt to these changes. I think the problem is that of methodology. People are trying to solve new-age problems with old-age tools; it&#8217;s not going to work. In this post, I attempt to explain my foregoing sentences.<br />
<span id="more-570"></span></p>
<p><strong>Fatalists and conservatives.</strong> Let us take a look at the two major camps on the issue of privacy today. On one side you have the likes of <a title="Mark Zukerberg on privacy" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebooks_zuckerberg_says_the_age_of_privacy_is_ov.php">Mark Zukerberg</a>, <a title="David Thomson on the future of privacy" href="http://volokh.com/2010/06/11/the-future-of-privacy-facial-recognition-public-facts-and-300-million-little-brothers/">David Thomson</a>, and <a title="BBC Article: Web attacks know where you live" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-10850875">Samy Kamkar</a> who believe that privacy is dead (the fatalists), and on the other side you have the likes of <a href="http://www.futureofprivacy.org/2008/11/15/the-future-of-privacy/">Future of Privacy Forum</a> and <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/03/the_future_of_p.html">Bruce Schneier</a> who believe that maintaining our privacy is only a matter of setting up the right legal/economic framework of incentives and disincentives within the present (and future) context (the conservatives).</p>
<p>Both camps have valid points. Despite all the brouhaha about privacy issues with facebook, facebook continues to add more users, and current users continue to treat facebook as their repository of their social life and social interactions. So maybe privacy really is dead! But the very fact that there is such a backlash reveals the fissure in society where you have a significant faction that jealously guards many of its actions and its information, but finds that it is not able to maintain its privacy because &#8216;other entities&#8217; (friends, banks, credit card companies, and such) are making them public. And there are still others who simply do not realize that what they think is private really is not. So the question is, what is the state of the art on this issue?</p>
<p><strong>Privacy vs. Security. </strong>The first problem that you encounter when trying to answer that question is that there no common understanding of what privacy really is. Often people bleed their concerns of security into the issue of privacy. This is muddying the waters to the point where no coherent narrative emerges. While security is and should always be a grave concern, it an orthogonal issue to privacy. One possible consequence of loss of privacy is that the security of our property and resources is at jeopardy, but that is not a basis to conflate privacy with security. There should be separate discussions on each issue. They may complement each other but one should not supplement the other. Remember, a secure life does not guarantee a private life!</p>
<p><strong>Privacy through public obscurity. </strong>Now that we know we talking exclusively about privacy and not security, we can move forward. In the past privacy has been protected largely due to the technological limitations that made several tasks intractable. Such intractability lead to privacy through public obscurity. For example, before the advent of telegraph and telephone, there was very little to worry about legitimate information about your activities (that you deem private) to your relatives in a different state. Why? Because of what I like to call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers">Chinese-Whispers</a> effect. But that changes with the ubiquity of telephones. Similarly, before the advent of the internet, at any point in your life, you were free to &#8216;reinvent&#8217; yourself by simply moving to a new town, getting a new job and simply not citing individuals from your old life as references. There was very little anyone could reasonably do to dig up your past life (of course, you could always hire a private-eye, but that would constitute an unreasonable effort).</p>
<p>In fact, the privacy of your online communications with your bank are established by privacy through public obscurity. Worried? Don&#8217;t be, not for now at least. All `secure&#8217; online communications use what is called public-key cryptography which involves dealing with numbers that have 100-200 digit prime numbers as their factors and encrypting messages with these numbers. In order to decrypt the message, one has to be able to factorize the large number into its constituent large prime numbers. The fastest-to-date mechanism to factorize a number is still by brute-force, and hence intractable. For even the fastest computers, this task could take years, by which time the contents of your private communication will be (hopefully) irrelevant. Thus, privacy through public obscurity.</p>
<p>I bring up the example of public-key encryption for a reason: the task of factorizing large numbers, although intractable right now, might not be so in the future (it wont be because the computer got faster, it will be because either <a title="Shor's factoring algorithm" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">quantum computers become a reality</a>, or the answer to the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem">P=NP problem</a> in computer science is the affirmative). If that happens, then what do you think society&#8217;s response will be? Do you do expect two camps: one that says cryptography is dead, and another one that says all mechanisms to factorize numbers should be outlawed or disincentivised some how? Of course not. That&#8217;s an absurd proposition! The response will be to build a better cryptographic technique that works despite the state of the art.</p>
<p>We are facing a similar situation with privacy today, and the two camps that I referred to earlier are not helping. The fact remains that these days more often than not <em>someone is hearing a tree fall</em> in the forest, and so more trees are making a sound when they fall. So how do we deal with it?</p>
<p><strong>First, learn to give up some of your privacy.</strong> Technology has made a lot of tasks tractable, and our physical and mental abilities and faculties are not evolving at a rate to match the pace of technology. Consequently, we are not able to make all our actions intractable to the new technology. So we have to give up some of our privacy. While this may be a ghastly notion for people in the western hemisphere, it is surprisingly common for societies in the eastern hemisphere to trade privacy for social support structure, security, and (more controversially) for happiness. Much like we have given up privacy for air flights but not for bus or train journeys, we may have to give up privacy in certain aspects of your life that we had otherwise considered to be private.</p>
<p>As for the natural follow-up question, what aspect of our privacy do we have to give up, I honestly don&#8217;t know. My speculations and proposals here are of methodological nature. I am not answering questions. I am just trying to figure out what the right questions to ask are! Isn&#8217;t that the first step in arriving at a resolution to our privacy issues?</p>
<p><strong>Second, indulge in information overload.</strong> The less information you give out, the more useful every extra bit of information about you is. Inevitably, despite your best efforts, more information about you will leak out. So how do you counter that? With information overload. Take <a title="Hasan Elahi's homepage" href="http://elahi.sjsu.edu/">Hasan Elahi</a> as a classic example. After he was erroneously put on the FBI terrorist watch list, and he had to endure a gruelling questioning by the FBI that took up hours of his time and ultimately to no one&#8217;s benefit, he decide to turn the tables on FBI. He put up a website called <a href="http://trackingtransience.net/">Tracking Transience</a> where he has up up pictures, videos, and all sorts of evidence of where he has been and what he has been doing every hour of every day! Since there is already so much information about him available, any additional information about him is not so useful any more. Curiously, he doesn&#8217;t appear in any of this photographs. He is one behind the camera. So in a sense although he has given you so much information about him, he really hasn&#8217;t given you anything that is remarkably useful. Paradoxically, by revealing so much about himself online, he has secured his privacy. [For details, visit: <a href="http://memes.org/tracking-transience-hasan-elahi">http://memes.org/tracking-transience-hasan-elahi</a>]</p>
<p>Ok, so Tracking Transience works for Hasan, what about the rest of us? Again, I am only showing you where to being asking the right questions; I do not have answers for you.</p>
<p>Are there any more tools of this or different kind that we can employ? Arguably, yes. One needs to look harder, and looks at different places. The new tools are different in kind, and presumably, in an ironic twist, an artefact the technology that has precipitated the issue of privacy in the first place.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my argument simply is that you cannot use old tools of fatalism, legal recourse, and economic regulation to frame the debate of privacy and expect a resolution. They are simply the wrong tools for the job! I will wrap this post up by continuing with the metaphor with which I started this article: <strong><em>if the tree falls in the forest and there are people to hear it, then let them hear it, but make sure that every minute sound made by the tree and the trees around it are perpetually amplified and broadcast to where the sound made by the falling tree become noise and simply irrelevant!</em></strong></p>
