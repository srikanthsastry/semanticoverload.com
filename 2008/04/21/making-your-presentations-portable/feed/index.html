		<description><![CDATA[Ah... That&#039;s strange, because their FAQ says something different.
Check out http://www.slideshare.net/faqs#5v
It says
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Q:[sic] My presentation file contains some audio and/or videos. Will that be available on SlideShare?
Ans.[sic] Currently, we do not support audio and videos embedded inside presentations.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So I am guessing that the audio synch is an mp3 file which plays in the background while the sildeshow is in progress. Or maybe it is the user narration of the presentation. Not sure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually I checked their site and saw this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;  - Embed slideshows into your own blog or website.
  - Share slideshows publicly or privately. There are several ways to share privately.
  - &lt;b&gt;Synch audio to your slides.&lt;/b&gt;
  - Market your your event on slideshare.
  - Join groups to connect with SlideShare members who share your interests
  - Download the original PowerPoint / Pdf file
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So it says we can actually sync audio with slides. 

Anyway, that said, I think AuthorPoint does suit your needs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Aditya: Well yes and no. With slideshare you have to upload your presentation to a publicly available server. Even if you can control who can view it, the content is still under someone else&#039;s administration, not necessarily someone who you trust. While Slideshare may work for presentations that are for public viewing, for a more focussed, narrow, and perhaps confidential audience, Slideshare is too insecure and too public. In those cases, Authorpoint is your best option.

Also Slideshare does not support any embedded audio, which is a deal breaker for someone who wants to have a portable presentation complete with the speakers narration for each slide. AuthorPoint can handle it perfectly well, but Slideshare cant.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post. Thanks!
I am the founder of authorGEN, the company behind authorPOINT Lite. I thought it would be good to add that if you are using authorPOINT lite, you can use the direct upload feature to upload your presentation to authorSTREAM, a PowerPoint sharing platform. You can then share your PowerPoint publicly or privately. Moreover, your presentation will also be available as video for sharing on YouTube or iPods.
I hope this helps :)]]></description>
