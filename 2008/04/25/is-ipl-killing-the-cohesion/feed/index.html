		<description><![CDATA[@Aditya About the national side chemistry becoming an issue 3-4 years down the line, yeah.. I can buy that. What I did not expect was it happening one within the first few weeks of IPL launching! And thats what worries me. I guess the question is: Is this incident a symptom, or just a blip on the radar? I have a sneaking suspicion that this may be a symptom of something larger at work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a fundamental difference here; at least for the moment that is. The fact that the IPL is only about a month and a half with international commitments dominating the rest of the calendar -- added to the Indian public&#039;s general obsession with the National side, the current squad should still not have as much of a problem. The problem with the NBA is that the national team is a side hastily assembled together who play a one-off tournament. 

However, if the IPL, and indeed the proposed &#039;EPL&#039;, grows in importance, market forces -- i.e., the business interests that run these tournaments will ask for a longer season and you would gradually see a domination of franchise loyalty over country.

But I guess, for that we&#039;d need to see how successful this current IPL season is. Will it sustain itself over the 44 day period? And as far as national side chemistry goes, we could see this as an issue possibly 3-4 years down the road when fan loyalty for franchises really gets partisan. Then you would see something like the England national soccer team are facing currently.]]></description>
