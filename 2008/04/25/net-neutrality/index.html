				<div class="entry-content">
<p><a title="Net neutrality" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality">Net Neutrality</a> has been an ongoing debate for quite a few years now. In its simplest terms, net neutrality is a principle that states that all traffic on the internet must be treated the same way; that there should be no preferential treatment to a specific kind or class of traffic. The are many camps for and against net neutrality. Each group fervently advocates its position on the issue, while slinging mud on the other camp. This debate has polarized large sections of stakeholders on the internet. Unfortunately, most of the polarization is based more on propaganda  and prejudice than facts. Investigating the net neutrality issue reveals that the waters are indeed quite muddy.<br />
<span id="more-158"></span><br />
The groups supporting net neutrality &#8212; like <a title="SAVE THE INTERNET Coalition" href="http://www.savetheinternet.com/">SaveTheInternet.com Coalition</a> &#8212; argue that net neutrality is fundamental to the success of the internet. Net Neutrality prevents ISPs from speeding up or slowing down Web content based on its source, ownership or destination. If ISPs are allowed to slow certain web content down and speed others up, based of Service Level Agreements (SLA) with content providers (like Reuters, Fox News, Yahoo, Google, Facebook etc.), then this will result in all big corporations signing SLAs with all ISPs, and individual content providers like bloggers will be left out in the cold, and there is little that can be done against such discrimination. In essence, the advocates argue that net neutrality an extension of free speech, and is necessary to protect free speech on the internet. Other implications of not having net neutrality include ISPs allowing (say) Google&#8217;s pages to load faster than (say) Yahoo&#8217;s (because Google signed an SLA with the ISP), thus denying its users efficient access to their trusted source of information.</p>
<p>The groups opposing net neutrality &#8212; like <a title="Hands Off The Internet" href="http://www.handsoff.org/">Hands Off The Internet Coalition</a> &#8212; argue that heavy regulation of the internet runs against free market economics, and that such restrictions slow down the rate of innovation on the internet. They argue that different kinds of internet traffic have different requirements. For instance, live chat requires less bandwidth, but the traffic cannot be delayed, on the other hand streaming video requires high bandwidth, but can afford some delay because the video is buffered at the viewing computer, downloads can withstand occasional delays and low bandwidth. It makes sense treat each of these traffic streams differently in order to provide a better user experience, but net neutrality prohibits this.</p>
<p>Lets see how the arguments for and against net neutrality really stand up to criticism.</p>
<p>Now, if net neutrality was implemented as a strict regulation, this can give rise to a lot problems. For instance, how do network providers treat spam under net neutrality? Currently, network providers can block spam at the entry point into their network. If the networks are expected to treat all traffic equally, then they have to treat spam the same as other traffic. Which implies that they are having to bear the cost of routing spam on their networks with no income from it. Guess who they will pass that cost on to: the consumers. So is net neutrality really what the consumers want?</p>
<p>If customers subscribed to a pay-per-view service over the internet, then customers have every right to be guaranteed a satisfactory viewing experience. However, the network provider cannot do that under net neutrality because the provider is not allowed to allocate bandwidth for the pay-per-view service. So is net neutrality really helping?</p>
<p>On the other hand, if net neutrality wasn&#8217;t implemented then this would allow network providers to treat different kinds of traffic differently, thus providing a better user experience. But if that were truly an issue then how do different classes of network traffic work well today without so-called &#8216;tiered&#8217; services for different classes of traffic. Answer: there is more bandwidth in the network core than the traffic consumes. As long as there is good admission control on the edge of the Internet, it doesn&#8217;t seem like you need such &#8216;tiered&#8217; services. Wouldn&#8217;t that make the &#8216;tiered&#8217; services argument too weak?</p>
<p>Consider the competition between VoIP services and traditional phone lines. Typically all your phone providers are also ISPs. And VoIP is very sensitive to delay in the traffic, more so than web browsing, streaming video, or downloads. So if the ISPs wanted to discourage their customer from using VoIP services, then they could do that by simply delaying packets for a few seconds randomly. For web browsing and other services, it would only show up as a few seconds delay in a page loading, or a delay in the video starting, which is easily tolerable. But with VoIP, this would show up as a jitter in a voice call. This would make VoIP unusable. Don&#8217;t we need regulations to protect the customers from such practices? Isn&#8217;t net neutrality a way out of this?</p>
<p>So net neutrality, while addressing some issues, opens up other problems which the Internet community will have to deal with. Worse, while it is easy to make a regulation like net neutrality, it is very difficult to enforce it. How do you detect a violation of net neutrality? If &#8216;bad&#8217; ISPs are smart enough, then they can hoodwink any mechanism to detect such violations. It can range from delaying all traffic for a few seconds so that only VoIP services are affected, to dropping only certain kinds of traffic during periods of traffic congestion. The above two techniques is indistinguishable from situations where a `good&#8217; ISP is having traffic management problems and so is forced to delay traffic, or is forced to drop traffic during congestion. So how do you distinguish &#8216;bad&#8217; ISPs from &#8216;good&#8217; one and penalize only the &#8216;bad&#8217; ones? Its not always possible.</p>
<p>So, if net neutrality is more a regulation in theory, than something which can be enforced successfully, and people do realize it, then why do we have groups advocating for it so strongly? What could be gained from it, other than a rhetorical stand on the ideals that they strive for? The answer might surprise you.</p>
<p>Ironically, the arguments being made on both sides of net neutrality fails to address the real issue. In fact, it serves to hide the real issue of why net neutrality has become such a focal point of conflict on the internet today. To understand this better, lets see who are the corporate entities involved in the net neutrality debate. The supporters of net neutrality include the likes of <a title="Google on Net neutrality" href="http://www.google.com/help/netneutrality.html">Google</a>, Yahoo, <a title="eBay on net neutrality" href="http://www.ebaymainstreet.com/federal/net-neutrality/">eBay</a> and <a title="AeA on net neutrality" href="http://www.aeanet.org/publications/AeA_CS_Net_Neutrality.asp">AeA</a>. The opposers of net neutrality include the likes of <a title="harware firms oppose net neutrality" href="http://www.news.com/2100-1028_3-6073629.html">3M, Cisco Systems, Qualcomm</a>, <a title="Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Time Warner oppose net neutrality" href="http://www.freepress.net/news/30594">Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Time Warner</a>. Note that there is a clear division of the functional roles of each camp. The camp which supports net neutrality are all content providers where as the camp which opposes net neutrality are all network infrastructure providers.</p>
<p>Why do content providers like net neutrality? Because it allows the content providers to innovate and come up with new applications and solutions without having to worry about how these application will be treated by the network. Why do network infrastructure providers oppose net neutrality? Because this will aloow for innovation and diversity in network infrastructure to accommodate new applications and solution which can evolve from the Internet. What does this mean? This means that net neutrality is no longer about free speech, or democracy, or free market, or any ideals. Its all about who gets to control the internet and the innovation in it. <strong>Net neutrality, under the hood, is an ongoing battle between content providers and infrastructure providers over who controls the web and the innovation in it.</strong></p>
