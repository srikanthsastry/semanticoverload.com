		<description><![CDATA[Captain Rajat Rana is an arrogant, unscrupolous pilot who is always in a foul mood and bad mouths the ground staff on the slightest of issues. Such Pilots think that they are God&#039;s blessings to Mankind and take the term Commander of the Ship too literally. He thinks he can stomp over us, the lowly ground staff because he is a Commander.

Here he went over board by using abusive language with the MP. Rana we believe also has a troubled married life and has an extra marital relationship with an ex air hostess of the airline. It seems it was the girl&#039;s birthday on April 9th and all his irritation and need to take off early was his personal desire to reach Delhi because he was carrying birthday gifts for her and wanted to be with her at mid night to wish her happy birthday. What a lover! Pity he has taken the passenger community, Indian Pilots Guild, Ministry and the Media for a huge big ride who all are busy in their Politician bashing without probing into the actual crux of the matter]]></description>
