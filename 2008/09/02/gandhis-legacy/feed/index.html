		<description><![CDATA[Nice post.

Gandhi&#039;s contribution to Independence might be much less than what our history books describe but it&#039;s not as marginal as what one might perceive after reading your post. 

His contribution to Freedom is, as you correctly mentioned, unparalleled.

		<description><![CDATA[@sri:
Actually India was not the first European colony to gain independence. Here are a few:
Indonesia in 1944 from the Dutch, Jordon in 1946 from the UK, Lebanon in 1943 from France,
Vietnam in 1945 from France.
Indonesia&#039;s independence was a direct consequence of Japanese invasion WWII, there was no &quot;freedom struggle&quot;, the Dutch were simply too impoverished to hold on to their colonies. In Jordon&#039;s case, the UK actually request the UN that Jordon be recognized as a sovereign nation, again no freedom struggle. Lebanon got its independence when France was invaded by Germany, and France couldn&#039;t recover fast enough to reclaim Lebanon. The French Colony of Vietnam has a similar story of independence. It was Japanese invasion in WWII followed by its defeat that liberated Vietnam.

It was WWII that triggered their independence, and in all cases the colonial powers simply did not have the resources to hold on to these colonies after the war. And my argument is that the British had successfully combated India&#039;s freedom struggle because of their vast economic and political might. WWII changed all that; it weaken Britain to the point that they no longer had the strength to hold their own in India, and so had little choice but to pull out. Had WWII never happened, Britain would have been as powerful in 1947, and would have been successful in combating the freedom struggle, and we may not have received our independence until much later.

With regards to colonies being held for decades after WWII, most were in Africa and very few among them actually had an independence movement of their own. So Europe pretty much got up and left on their own accord in these places.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Among all the erstwhile European colonies, India was the first to gain independence. Others followed suit eventually. Was WWII the sole reason for the Independence? Would European powers have given up their colonies had their been no independence movements in these places? They certainly didn&#039;t give up their colonies after WWI, and held on to several smaller colonies for decades beyond WWII.

You say, Gandhi was responsible to give a social identity for Indians as a whole. Maybe it is precisely because of this social identity, the British found it impossible to rule over India any longer? Remember, their strategy to conquer India was to divide and rule. Maybe that is what your history books were trying to convey?

Things are not that simple, please...]]></description>

India&#039;s freedom movement helped in uniting india against a common enemy (the imperialist britain) and introduced the ideals of democracy , equality , liberty and freedom .

		<description><![CDATA[@shirnath:
First, I&#039;d appreciate it if you at least commented with a real email address so that I may at least authenticate your identity. But nevertheless, here&#039;s the answer to your question.

I did lay down the facts for everyone to see. The comments section have served to clarify my arguments. For instance, the comparison between India and Pakistan&#039;s political stability. I haven&#039;t held myself back in saying that Gandhi may have become an expensive liability if he was allowed to influence and dictate free India&#039;s politics.

Despite these, if you choose to doubt the sincerity of my post, then please let me know what words/arguments/ideas would convince you otherwise. If there aren&#039;t any, then I guess its a matter of faith to take my statements at face value. I&#039;ll leave that up to you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@routinated: True indeed. Regarding Gandhi not being around to oversee a stable India, I am not convinced that Gandhi was the right person to be indulged in free India&#039;s politics. Simply because he was extremely influential and a (secular, pacifistic) fundamentalist. I dread imagining how India would have handled the 1948 aggression by Pakistan with Gandhi&#039;s insistence on non-violence (to the point where he urged Churchill to let German troops march into London).]]></description>
