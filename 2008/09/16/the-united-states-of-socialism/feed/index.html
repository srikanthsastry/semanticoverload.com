		<description><![CDATA[I am so mad at the people that have created this failure. I see the fat man Dodd of Ct playing the holier than thou along with his co hearts in crime, Binden, Reed , Pelosie. I think they should all be charged with Treason and removed from the house and senate. 
You tell me what will it take to regain control of our country, I think back to last year when another fat senator who claimed our troops were raiding houses, killing citizens of Iraq and every evil thing that could spit from his mouth. Since the soliders were cleared of the charge one solider filed suit aganist this fat cat senator, he is now silent. 
I am open to suggestions to turn the country around.]]></description>
