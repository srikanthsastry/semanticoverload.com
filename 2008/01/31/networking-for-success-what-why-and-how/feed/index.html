		<description><![CDATA[Well actually my email address (unprotected and hyper-linked) was put in there for everyone to see and all spambots to harvest. In fact, I even received a few spam messages. So I put in a request to have it fixed, put it in text (like someone _ AT_ NOSPAM domain _POINT_ com), or as a jpg or something that spambots cannot harvest but humans can use it. Their response to that was to delete my email address completely! Oh well :)]]></description>
