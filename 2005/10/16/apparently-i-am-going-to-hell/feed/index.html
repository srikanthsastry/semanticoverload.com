		<description><![CDATA[WEll, my dear, you are correct...it was too much like listening to the Jehovah&#039;s witness who so many times learn what they hear and are drummed to the moan instead of the sticks in which to learn to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have learned in my Christian walk it is not what you say, but what you really believe that is the core of your being. I have read many different Bibles and there are parts in each that are very much in tune with what God had intended for all individuals and that was to reach out in love to one another freely and sacrifically and that too was the message brought by Jesus. or perhaps to you, Mohammed is his name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someday, in their journeys, they will learn you catch alot more hummiong birds with honeysuckle than with a thornbush! But that is another adventure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many blessings Semantic, match well done? I suppose it depends on one&#039;s perspective. :0-)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;all my love,&lt;br/&gt;Peg]]></description>
