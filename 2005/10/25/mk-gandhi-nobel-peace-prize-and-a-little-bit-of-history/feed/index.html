		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I doubt if Gandhi would have accepted the prize anyway.&lt;br/&gt;There is a bigger issue to confront here. Forget the Nobel Prize recognizing what Gandhi did, most of the people in India are actually anti-Gnadhi and claim that if there would have been an arms struggle , we would have got independence faster. I have argued endlessly about this with these kind of people, but to no use. What Einstein said will become true, &quot;200 years later people will not believe that there existed a man like Mahatma Gandhi&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PS- I am your brother&#039;s friend, got here form his blog, first time I have read your post, great going.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It’s pathetic that Mahatma Gandhi who actually defined the words Nonviolence and Peace, has not given Noble prize for peace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well in conclusion It can be said, &lt;br/&gt;1) Gandhi is too big for any such prize.&lt;br/&gt;2) Its unfortunate for ‘Nobel Peace Prize’ that it failed to associate it self with Gandhi.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Most people have pretty extreme opinions on Gandhi in India, as far as I have seen. Some worship him, some despise him. Its still a controversial topic. I guess it must be a huge thing to say for a man that even so many years after his death, both factions still feel so strongly about him and argue so violently on the topic]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well.. I came here after a long time, and what do I see, a thought provoking post. :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First of all, I don&#039;t think Hitchcock didn&#039;t win any oscar, nor did Scorsese. There are others in the list I guess. And Saif Ali Khan got the award for the best actor in Hum Tum. :). Not that there are any links between any of these, just random thoughts I had in mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Stormcrowes comment had me thinking. I am sure the father of the nation is feeling guilty already for a lot of reasons, some of them below. :)&lt;br/&gt;# The majority of the people do not obey the law, starting from the simplest like traffic rules. We have never been told to get out of the &quot;non-cooperation&quot; since the government is now run by our people.&lt;br/&gt;# Harthals and Bundhs are being used for everything other than people&#039;s welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are more, but don&#039;t have the time and inclination to put. :)]]></description>
