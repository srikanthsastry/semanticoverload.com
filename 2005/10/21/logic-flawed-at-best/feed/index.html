		<description><![CDATA[semantic overload,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had to chime in on this post. :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMNSHO, logic is a tool for consistency checking.  More broadly, mathematics is an enumeration of all self-consistent structures.  If nature is self-consistent (e.g., events either happen or don&#039;t happen, but not both), then nature has to be isomorphic to a mathematical system.  In that case, the scientific method is the only way to study nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We create theories about the logical structure of nature and then seek to validate or falsify those theories empirically.  Similarly, we create theories about the meaning of language propositions in each context in which they are used.  We merely require that the uncertainty in our theories of physics and language be reducible to some small enough level to achieve a given task, e.g., to build a airplane, teach a concept, or cook from a recipe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus, to give up on science one must sacrifice either logic or the consistency of nature.  Yet, if you give these things up, you cannot know anything (at least not anything expressable as a logical proposition) nor make any predictions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let me put it another way.  Without logic, &quot;France is in Europe&quot; and &quot;France is not in Europe&quot; could not be shown to be inconsistent.  Thus, without logic, we could trust both with equal confidence.

The Conjecture may be an example of a proposition that cannot be proven, but which is true nonetheless.  I really don&#039;t see this as a problem for either logic or mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The axioms of logic simply reflect its consistency.

		<description><![CDATA[Peg, thank you for your comment.  Paul was writing to those churches to warn them of where they were straying and we have the same issues to this day.  However, even though you know it is a personal relationship with Jesus and by His blood, grace we are saved, we are still to be a part of the Body of Christ.  I am sorry you have had a bad experience with organized religion but God is of order not chaos.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kristen]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good Job, Semantic! Doctor Logic (you can find him on the right side of my site)is always debating logic and metaphysics and the such in his site! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Semantic, I really enjoyed the way you have opened yourself up to truths and logic and philosophy.&lt;br/&gt;Keep searching and with God&#039;s help you will learn the truth!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And annonymous, I disagree with you on organized religion (to a certain point). Yes, organized religion is &#039;supposed&#039; to take the money from the coffers to help those in need, but is that the case? I have seen organized religion in particular sects and found it to be more hungry for implements other than the welfare of the human race.&lt;br/&gt;But as I have said prior, not all organized religion, just those who have become much like the church of Ephesus (left their first love), Pergamos (worship idols and their children have learned and commit fornication) Thyatira (ditto Pergamos), Sardis (forgotten), Laodiceans (sit on the fence).&lt;br/&gt;Rev 2:1-29, Rev 3:1-22]]></description>

That is what the tithes and offerings are for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While society needs scientists and the curious, look at what has happenned to our schools since we added Darwin and took out prayer and the ten commandments.
