		<description><![CDATA[@t_stormcrowe: In fact, this was my first glimpse of a natural cave, so I really dont know much about it. I am fascinated though. I hope there are more of them to see around in TX. And hey, hope to get fit enough to start spelunking fairly soon :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;@peg: Thanks for your compliments :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OOPS typed gibberish before!  The cave pics are great!  Of course I was a caver when I was a kid!  When I get a little healthier, I plan to introduce my beloved spouse to spelunking as well!  Even if the rest of the weekend was bad, it looks like the caves made up for it!]]></description>
