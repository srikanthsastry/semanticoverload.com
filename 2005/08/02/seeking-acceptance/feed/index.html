		<description><![CDATA[Well to be accepted is to be a part of the society... to be normal.. to be in ... some can do without but they also come back and connect at some point.. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I personally prefer to blend in with many groups from different area so that I do not have to feel myself being dependent on one group for my acceptance... :) slowly you learn to be on your own with being accepted.. I guess thats life.. its your choice ultimately... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PS: try giving a line space ... between the paras.. makes for easy reading.. :) &lt;br/&gt;Also my travel logs are at http://travellogs.blogspot.com]]></description>
