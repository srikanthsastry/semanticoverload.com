		<description><![CDATA[Hi,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just heard that you spoke with Patrix, and were taken aback that I had a blog ! We just kinda assumed you knew :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, my bad, I forgot to send you a trackback. I&#039;m so used to blogspot sites not having trackbacks, that it slipped my mind completely !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking foward to meeting up later this week ...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, my name is Peg and I came in from Ash&#039;s blogsite. The crime listed was truly one that is not only criminal but indeed a crime against another human being due to race, gender, etc. Had it not been for the name calling I would have believed this to be just a random act of violence by a group of individuals who have no more sense or dignity for life than that of fire ants!&lt;br/&gt;My heart goes out to this young man and his new perspective on how his once safe haven has been turned into a hellish nightmare that no one should have to enter!! I do pray they will find those responsible and are truly brought to justice! And I pray that one day this world can stand hand in hand one color upon another!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;all my love,&lt;br/&gt;Peg]]></description>
