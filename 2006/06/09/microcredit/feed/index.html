		<description><![CDATA[So...I ended up not having to go to work, so i thought I would comment on this.

Very well done.  Microcredit is amazing, and when you go and talk to the people who have benefitted from it the most, it is amazing!  I had a chance to meet with some women while I was in India, and it was truly the most touching and moving moment while I was there; definently something I hope to remember for a long time, and keep in mind in my future career.  These women had a new lease on life and high aspirations for their children...and their children&#039;s children. If I remember right, one said that she was going to make sure that her son was Prime Minister someday.  (In this case, microcredit was being administered by FODRA, which also did other community development projects).

The whole concept of microcredit started with the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh (I&#039;m sure you already knew that, being so smart ;0) )]]></description>
