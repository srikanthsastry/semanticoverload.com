		<description><![CDATA[@ mudit &amp; srikanthsastry: The point which you mentioned about call forwarding. I dont know how you are able to do it but as far as I know one can forward only calls originating from Skype users based in US or Canada in such a way and you cannot forward calls received from Skype users abroad.

@srikanthsastry: internet could be browsed in India after connecting to iPid but was unable to login to skype.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have tried a different solution which is much simpler. Conncect using Skype with the person you want to talk on his computer, but instruct that guy not to answer the call on his computer. The guy you want to talk to should have a forwarding number, which can be his cell phone or any other number. Skype will forward the call to the cell phone and its FREE! I have tried this and it works without a hitch. I have my desktop on and Skype connected at all times at home. My parents call on this computer using their Skype account and it gets forwarded to my cell phone. No charge. You dont even have to activate Skypeout.]]></description>
