Blog name: Chronosynclastic Infundibulum
Tag line: My Pensieve for all to see
Hm.

And by the way, &quot;infact?&quot; There is no such word.

And &quot;I think I speak for a vast majority of bloggers when I say that their sacred objective to attract as many readers as possible to their blogs.&quot;
Perhaps you mean &quot;I think I speak for a vast majority of bloggers when I say that their sacred objective is to attract as many readers as possible to their blogs.&quot;

And
The natural question to ask is, “What can be done to get more people to read your blog?”.
You don&#039;t need that full stop.

&quot;I scoured theblogs&quot;
Perhaps you meant you scoured the blog world, or the blogosphere, if you prefer neologisms. Or perhaps &quot;theblogs&quot; is the name of a source I don&#039;t recognise? In which case, my apologies.

The suggested target audience would all the casual users of the internet who have an interest in developing and maintaining their website/blog but are not a html or web wiz.

The suggested target audience would &lt;b&gt;be&lt;/b&gt; all the casual users of the internet who have an interest in developing and maintaining their website&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;/blog&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt; but are not a html or web wiz&lt;b&gt;zes&lt;/b&gt;.
Actually, considering your advice later about brevity and simplicity, perhaps this would be better:
The suggested target audience: casual web users interested in developing and maintaining their websites or blogs, but without too much tech wizardry.

And I&#039;m sure you meant &quot;jargon&lt;b&gt;-&lt;/b&gt;ladden&quot;

And this post could have been written in about half the length if it had used its own suggestions.

		<description><![CDATA[If we mistake &#039;good&#039; writing to mean only &#039;correct&#039; writing as in readability where we concentrate on grammar, sentence structure, and the rest, leaving out the importance of content as in its quality, then we&#039;re treading shaky ground.

I&#039;ve read lot many blogs that are big on polish but low on substance. Of course, there are many who’ll say that substance is subjective. Fair enough. But then no content, however well written from a language point of view, can afford to mirror the structure, nature, and tenor of blog-content that proliferate on the web, mind numbing in their repetitive nature, almost identical in their crib-a-thons, and inability to offer different personal perspectives. Though it is another matter that most such blogs do acquire medium to large readership who keep coming back for more.

I would say that language matters, but content matters more, though the latter cannot do without the former. Having said that, it might help to not agonize over ‘lack of numbers’ who read your blog for, if you believe in your content for the value you’ve built into it, then even if you get few committed readers you’ll have succeeded.

To write so that you cater to the taste of maximum readers will mean you will orient your writing, and content similar to most blogs out there that offer a bit of spice, and ‘cool talk’. Retain your voice even if it rings out frail in the jungle, for, there might just be a Mynah or two around who’ll heed your call and wing down to sit on your shoulder to hear what you have to say. Then maybe they’ll fly off and pass the word around for more of their kind. Until then, believe in your voice.

For starters, it’ll do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@paavni: Like I said, the most important thing is targeting your audience correctly. If you would like to maintain a blog as a creative writing practice, then by all means use the most difficult words you know. But if you are trying to get a point across, if you are trying to communicate a view point, and you would like your reader to read them and understand them. Then you will have to write clearly, understandably, using the guidelines that I have outlined. These guidelines are not very difficult to follow. If you notice, the points I have made can be put to practice by a high school kid. So far as using lingos go.. well, if your audience uses a lot of lingo and can follow what you are trying to say, then go for it. If you would like the whole world to read ur blog, then using lingos is probably not the best way to go about :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recently convinced a friend that she wants to get a blog, and we started one for her. And the main thing I told her was that...well, just write. Don&#039;t worry about grammer, spelling, corrections, properness, what your audience wants. A blog rewards you for writing. It&#039;s very simple, the more you write the more hits you get. If that&#039;s what you are going for. If my blog was like some newspaper article/opinion piece I wrote, then it really wouldn&#039;t be fun or very interesting to me.]]></description>

BTW, use the  tag for long posts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think I have to respectfully disagree with you. Over at Successful Blog we talk a lot about what makes good writing. We have checks for editing for quality as well as content editing and word usage and the piece you discuss &quot;6 1 Traits of Effective Writing&quot; is the first in the Series.

I do agree that writing is important which is why I started the entire power writing series which goes through all of the steps of the writing process and how each step contributes to making the piece stronger. Pieces on voice and audience are in lncluded. I&#039;ve seen plenty of articles on grammar.

Perhaps your phrasing and word choice &quot;scour the blogs&quot; was just unfortunate. I&#039;d love to have a conversation with you about this.

Also you might try Google Blog Search.

Thanks for noticing what I&#039;m doing. :)

Smiles,
