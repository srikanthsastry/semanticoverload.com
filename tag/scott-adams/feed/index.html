				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Among the many blogs I read, today&#8217;s curious case was from the latest post in <a href="http://quietbabylon.com/">Quiet Babylon</a> and the <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/">Scott Adams&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>
<p>Tim Maly, the author of Quiet Babylon, in today&#8217;s post dated Sept. 3rd 2010, talks about the concept, history, fiction, and reality of <a href="http://quietbabylon.com/2010/whats-a-cyborg/">Cyborgs</a>. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>So when you think about <em><strong>cyborgs</strong></em>, [...] Donâ€™t think about total loss of self, bodies encroached and erased by technology, humanity swallowed whole. Instead think of <em><strong>cellphones</strong></em>. Think about <em><strong>off-loaded memories</strong></em>, of constantly renewed enhancement and new abilities. But also think about insistent ringtones, and demanding interruptions, think of externally controlled access, and a reliance on a sprawling infrastructure.<em> [emphasis added]</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Curiously, Scott Adams, on the same day, <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/phone/">talks about cell phones</a> and the need for renaming the device. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>My suggestion, which I offer simply to prime the pump, is to call the <em><strong>phone</strong></em> your &#8220;head.&#8221; This term recognizes that you are essentially a <em><strong>cyborg</strong></em> with a detachable brain. You <em><strong>offload a lot of your memory </strong></em>into your device, and it helps you communicate and gather information, just like the other parts of your general skull area.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also, neither post links to the other or even acknowledges the other&#8217;s existence. I think it&#8217;s really curious that two people would elucidate identical ideas on almost the same subject on the same day. If it&#8217;s a coincidence, it&#8217;s one hell of a coincidence. Plagiarism anyone?</p>
