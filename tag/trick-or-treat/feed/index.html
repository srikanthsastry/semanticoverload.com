				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bush, Cheny, Libby, Rumsfelt, and others probably loved Halloween more than any other holiday. Something tells me that the lessons they took away from Halloween was the primary motivation for the foreign policy that they chose for their hapless nation. Still with me? No? Then let me explain.</p>
<p>Halloween is the Christianized bastardization of the wonderful Celtic harvest festival called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain">Samhain</a>. One of the more relatively recent bastardization is called &#8216;Trick-or-treating&#8217; (it started circa 1930s). Trick-or-treating typically involves children going from house to house asking for candy with the question &#8216;Trick or treat?&#8217; (Leaving all the pedophiles salivating in the process). The &#8216;treat&#8217; part being a ritualized begging for candy, and the &#8216;trick&#8217; part referring to the threat of playing a trick on the owner of house, or on the property itself.</p>
<p>So yeah, we have trick-or-treating during Halloween. There is a name for this whole process of asking for candy or threatening with not-so-pleasant consequences &#8211; back where I come from, its called <em>Extortion</em>.</p>
<p>Coming back to my original claim, have you noticed how US likes to talk to other nations? &#8212; &#8220;Give us your oil, or we&#8217;ll invade you country under a false pretext&#8221;, &#8220;Surrender you nuclear technology to us, only we should have nuclear weapons, not you. Or else, we&#8217;ll impose sanctions on you&#8221;, &#8220;Remove your subsidies agriculture (but we&#8217;ll keep ours) so that we can dump our surplus in your market, or else we will ban import of your goods into the US&#8221;, and so on.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but that sounds a lot like trick-or-treat to me! Like I said, Bush, Cheny,and co. must have loved trick-or-treating during Halloween, coz&#8217; they are doing it with the rest of the world today; only this time thousands end up dying for their (Bush and Cheny&#8217;s) amusement.</p>
