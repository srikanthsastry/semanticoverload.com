				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With due apologies to <a href="http://www.safelibraries.org/lehrer_tom__smut.mp3">Tom Lehrer</a>&#8230; Actually the SMUT I am talking about is an acronym S.M.U.T.: &#8220;Subversive Manifesto for Underground Technology.&#8221; It is a monthly event that was started by <a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/hammond/">Tracy Hammond</a> (<a title="Tracey Hammond on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/tracyhammond">twitter</a>), C<a href="http://codymarxbailey.com/">ody Marx Bailey</a> (<a title="Cody Marx Bailey on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/superphly">twitter</a>), and Christopher Zebo in Bryan/College Station, Texas, USA. The &#8220;official&#8221; blurb is:<a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/08/smut.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-612 alignright" title="smut" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/08/smut.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="259" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>S.M.U.T. is famous academics giving you ten minute talks that will alter your perspective on the direction of the universe. Subversive talks bring for dangerous ideas. (Technology is as technology does.) Talks will be interspersed with technology installation pieces (did we say robots?), blooper research video reels, and art displays from local artists.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is my take on it: S.M.U.T. is an effort to bring technology to people (and get people to understand and accept it) before technology <em>gets</em> (in the sense of trickery) to people. Yesterday was the second edition of S.M.U.T. at <a href="http://staffordmainstreet.com/">Stafford Main</a> and much like the first, it was very interesting and fairly successful. You don&#8217;t have to take my word for it, check out the buzz about <a title="hashtag #ilovesmut" href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23ilovesmut">S.M.U.T. on twitter</a>.<span id="more-608"></span></p>
<p>There were talks on green technology, and how its much more than just windmills and solar panels; robots as truth seeking devices; the nature of privacy online; and the talks, although interesting on their own merit, were punctuated and complemented by some impressive slam poetry.</p>
<p>The first edition had talks on how every time there is a new communication/storage technology, satan and aliens seem to start communicating with us using that technology; experience report by a researcher who worked with Mars rovers; and many more.</p>
<p>I personally enjoyed it, and I think its a great initiative among many to bring an understanding and appreciation of science and technology to everyone. If you are in the Bryan/College Station area, and you are an artist, a designer, a researcher, an entrepreneur, or something who has something interesting, creative, and subversive to share, please contact Tracey Hammond and/or Cody Marx Bailey to be a speaker/presenter at a future S.M.U.T.</p>
<p>If you are not in the Bryan/College Station area, then consider starting one in your own community. I think it&#8217;s a much needed effort if we as a society are to learn to use our ever-advancing technology as an agent for progress.</p>
