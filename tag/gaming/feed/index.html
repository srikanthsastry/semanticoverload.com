Played <a href="http://www.dungeonkeeper2.com" target="_blank">Dungeon Keeper 2</a> for over 4 hrs! it&#8217;s an awesome game that combines RPG and strategy gaming. It&#8217;s fun, and some of the humour there is rolicking (like when you dont make a move in a while, the narrator says &#8220;Every rock in your dungeon is yawning in anctipation of your next brilliant move&#8221;). It&#8217;s a definite must play game. Its amazing time pass. Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Met up with Vipin yesterday. He gave me <a href="http://moo3.quicksilver.com/" target="_blank">Masters of Orion-3</a>, a turn based strategy game. I am still grappling with the controls and trying to figure out how to play the same. Right now I am hopelessly plagued with spies infesting my planets and assasinaing my leaders, reseachers and stealing my technologies :(</p>
<p>I have always been a strategy games fan, especially turn based games, and let me tell you <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/empires/" target="_blank">Age of Empires</a> and it&#8217;s sequels and expansion kits suck BIG TIME!! The AI is competely screwed. The best strategy games I have played have been by SID MIER, including <a href="http://www.firaxis.com/smac/" target="_blank">Alpha Centauri</a>,<a href="http://www.railroadtycoon3.com" target="_blank"> Rail Road Tycoon</a>and <a href="http://www.civ3.com" target="_blank">Civilizations III</a>. And then there is <a href="http://www.firaxis.com/cwc/" target="_blank">Gyttesberg</a>, it&#8217;s not much in terms of playing standards, but impressed me mopst about it is the level of details to which you can go to in the game. You con control and entire army, or a battallion or get down to even a single cannon! Now that&#8217;s control!!</p>
<p>The look and feel of alpha centuari and civ3 are very similar, almost like they use the same engine, but in civ3, the challenge level has been notched up a level, and that makes it far more interesting than alpha centuari. For people starting out on strategy games, I would recommend Alpha Centuari. It will take you some to get used ot the user interface with zillions of options and menus, but you have got the hang of it, is becomes increasingly addictive and the craving for it simply refuses to die. I once spent 26 hours non stop on the PC playing this game, taking breaks only to have my lunch, dinner and bath :)</p>
<p>Any strategy game fans around? If you are a AOE fan, then you are NOT a strategy game fan. Folks, buzz in, I need an education on this one. My knowledge may be outdated ;)</p>
