		<description><![CDATA[Recently there have been reports of a terrorist group aligned with LeT planning on hijacking an Air India flight and  using paragliders to launch suicide attacks against India. The kind of lucidity, clarity, and specificity in the news reports seemed unusual (almost unprecedented) for India. Looks like among the lessons learnt from 26/11 is that it is not sufficient to just do your job, you need to make sure that your stakeholders (the people of India) know that you are doing your job. In other words PR/marketing. So are we going to see more 'transparency' from the government on intelligence information and credibility of terrorists threats?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently there have been reports of a terrorist group aligned with Al-Qaeda, LeT (<a title="Wikipedia entry for LeT &quot;army of the righteous&quot;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lashkar-e-Toiba">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a>, for the uninitiated) a.k.a. JuD (<a title="Wikipedia entry for JuD" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamat-ud-Dawa">Jamat-ud-Dawa</a>) planning on hijacking an Air India flight [source: <a title="News article titled &quot;Terror alert: Plan to hijack Indian plane&quot;" href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/terror-alert-plan-to-hijack-indian-plane/570428/">Indian Express</a>] and reports of LeT possibly using paragliders to launch suicide attacks against India [source: <a title="News article titled &quot;After hijack threat, now LeT paragliders&quot;" href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/after-hijack-threat-now-let-paragliders/570813/">Indian Express</a>]. These reports have prompted the home ministry to deploy air marshals on all flights [source: <a title="&quot;Following this input, the civil aviation ministry has directed all the airlines especially Air India to take extra steps besides asking Bureau of civil aviation security to deploy sky marshals on aircraft operating on such routes, the sources said. &quot;" href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Hijack-threat-AI-planes-put-on-high-alert/articleshow/5487289.cms">The Times of India</a>] and tighten security over vital installations [source: <a title="&quot;The intelligence input which came barely days ahead of Republic Day celebrations has prompted authorities to ensure a tight air security around all vital installations, official sources said here on Friday. &quot;" href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Lashkar-readies-para-gliders-to-launch-suicide-attack-on-India-Intel/articleshow/5488687.cms">The Times of India</a>].</p>
<p>The kind of lucidity and clarity in the news reports seemed unusual. Typically the reasons for such &#8220;high alert&#8221; is one of the following three:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Reactionary</strong>, that is, in response to confirmed terrorist activity. Examples:
<ul>
<li>July 14, 1997: Himachal Pradesh was put on alert after field officials admitted that terrorists have been entering Himachal for re-grouping and planning attacks [<a title="Indian Express article: &quot;Himachal Pradesh put on alert as militancy threatens State&quot;" href="http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19970715/19650033.html">source</a>].</li>
<li>June 28, 2003: Army formations were on full alert following a suicide attack on a Dogra battalion camp [<a title="June 28th 2003 - The Hindu news article: Army formations on full alert" href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2003/06/29/stories/2003062904510100.htm">source</a>].</li>
<li>July 22, 2003: Army formations in Jammu &amp; Kashmir were put of full alert following two major suicide attacks on army camps and intelligence reports that there may be more [<a title="Jully 22, 2003 Indian Express news article &quot;Pak pushing militants into Jammu region: Army&quot;" href="http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=23244">source</a>].</li>
<li>October 1, 2003: Troops along the Indo-Pak border were put on high alert after Pak army&#8217;s Border Action Teams provided cover fire to push terrorists into Jammu and Kashmir [<a title="01 Oct. 2003 Silicon India article: Troops put on alert along LoC to stop Pak sabotage group" href="http://www.siliconindia.com/shownews/Troops_put_on_alert_along_LoC_to_stop_Pak_sabotage_group-nid-20999.html">source</a>].</li>
<li>November 12, 2007: Army was placed on alert in Jammu &amp; Kashmir after terrorist &#8220;sleeper cells&#8221; had become active [<a title="Nov 17 2007 Bloombery news article &quot;India Says Army on Alert for Kashmir Terrorist Cells &quot;" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aLqqTH0oankA&amp;refer=home">source</a>].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Obvious</strong>: on occasions like the Republic day or Independence day, or during known periods of terrorist infiltration. Examples:
<ul>
<li>January 26, 2003: Delhi, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, and the Northeast were put under high alert to safeguard against terrorist threats to disrupt the Republic Day celebrations [<a title="PTI news: &quot;States under high alert for R-Day&quot;" href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/jan/25alert.htm">source</a>].</li>
<li>March, 18 2004: Indian forces were put on hight alert because the melting snow along the LoC at the end of winter increases terrorist infiltration [<a title="March 18 2004 The Times of India article &quot;Forces on alert as melting snow eases infiltration&quot;" href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/567248.cms">source</a>].</li>
<li>August 14, 2007: Security forces around New Delhi were on high alert for Independence day to safeguard against terror attacks [<a title="Aug 14, 2009 Bloomberg article &quot;India Boosts Independence Day Security; Keeps al-Qaeda in Mind&quot;" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&amp;sid=a7iIZdKv0RsI&amp;refer=india">source</a>].</li>
<li>August 15, 2008: India rolled out a security clampdown ahead of the Independence Day [<a title="Aug 15 2008 Reuters article &quot;India on high alert as it celebrates Independence Day&quot;" href="http://in.reuters.com/article/companyNews/idINDEL12225520080814">source</a>].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong> Secretive or vague</strong> information. Examples:
<ul>
<li>July 13, 2006: Army cantonments were put on high alert following intelligence reports that terrorists could carry our suicide attacks [<a title="July 13 2006 The Hindu article &quot;High alert in cantonments&quot;" href="http://www.hindu.com/2006/07/13/stories/2006071322920100.htm">source</a>].</li>
<li>January 11, 2007: Airports across India were put on high alter follows intelligence reports on possible attempt by terrorists to hijack an aircraft or storm airport terminals [<a title="Jan 11 2007 Indian Express article &quot;Airports on alert after terror threat&quot;" href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/airports-on-alert-after-terror-threat/20638/">source</a>].</li>
<li>January 16, 2008: Central security agencies were put on guard following intelligence reports of a possible suicide attack by a Pakistan-based militant group on &#8220;VIPs&#8221; in Jammu &amp; Kashmir [<a title="Jan 16 2008 PTI news article titled &quot;LeT, Jaish planning to attack Azad, Omar; Security revamped&quot;" href="http://www.thehindu.com/holnus/001200801161655.htm">source</a>].</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In contrast the news articles on possible hijacking and paragliding suicide attacks provided us with a lot more and specific information. It seemed to come with more authority, almost trying to convince us that the government is doing its job and is very serious about security. Looks like among the lessons learnt from 26/11 (and mind you that there ARE <a title="Wide Angle View of India: &quot;Improvements in security arrangements in India after 26/11 (Mumbai Terror Attacks)&quot;" href="http://nitawriter.wordpress.com/2009/11/26/improvements-in-security-arrangements-in-india-after-911/">changes in policy</a> and<a title="The Acorn: &quot;The change of NSA is a manifestation of deeper change&quot;" href="http://acorn.nationalinterest.in/2010/01/18/the-change-of-nsa-is-a-manifestation-of-deeper-change/"> execution effected by those lessons</a>) is that it is not sufficient to just do your job, you need to make sure that your stakeholders (the people of India) know that you are doing your job. In other words PR/marketing.Â So are we going to see more &#8216;transparency&#8217; from the government on intelligence information and credibility of terrorists threats?</p>
<p>Interestingly, in April 2003, security was beefed up around the Vaishno Devi Temple in Jammu &amp; Kashmir following (specific) intelligence warning about a possible suicide attack [<a title="PTI article in Indian Express dated April 2 2003: &quot;Intelligence warns attack on Vaishno Devi&quot;" href="http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=20223">source news article</a>]. The news article reported: &#8220;Although inputs regarding general threat perceptions are received regularly, the threat is specific this time,&#8221; the sources said. So, a less flattering interpretation is that Indian intelligence has been doing what it can, but its work was of really poor quality, and hence the secretive or vague information on terror threats, and hence a catastrophic intelligence failure that lead to 26/11. Post-26/11, there has been a revamping of the Intelligence and now we are finally getting quality intelligence.</p>
<p>A more cynical possibility is that the 2003 Vaishno Devi alter, and the recent two specific intelligence alert were all just accidents! Indian Intelligence simply got lucky, and so don&#8217;t expect anything much to change at all!</p>
<p>Wonder where the truth really lies&#8230;</p>
