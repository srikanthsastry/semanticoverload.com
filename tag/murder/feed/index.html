				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As early as 2006, the US military started falling short on it&#8217;s recruitment numbers, but they made the<a title="US military recruiting and retention website" href="http://www.army.mil/recruitingandretention/"> target recruitment numbers and more</a>. Obviously, with two wars to participate in, meeting this goal was imperative. But in doing so, they had to cut corners. The military started <a title="NY Times 2007 article on military recruitment of ex-cons" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/14/us/14military.html">recruiting people with criminal backgrounds</a> including murderers by issuing the so-called &#8220;<a title="Wikipedia article on moral waivers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_waiver">moral waivers</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>The reaction to such recruitment has ranged from <a title="2006 article on SFgate.com decrying recruitment of felons in the military" href="http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-10-01/opinion/17315471_1_recruits-criminal-records-military">outrage</a> to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/21/AR2008042103295.html">ambivalence</a> to <a href="http://www.statenews.com/index.php/article/2008/04/recruiting_felons_for_military_risky_unavoidable">resignation</a>. But the effect of recruiting felons into the military has not been sufficiently illuminated. The military has been <a title="Julian Assange of wikileaks urges the US to investigate abuse by their soldiers" href="http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2010/11/04-5">accused of hiding</a> any moral or pragmatic ill effects that may have been precipitated by such large numbers of felons in the military. Incidentally, the evidence of such <a title="wikileaks war logs" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/22/wikileaks-iraq-war-logs-i_n_772658.html">ill effects</a> and <a title="US military issues secret orders to ignore abuse by soldiers" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-detainee-abuse-torture-saddam">complacency of the military</a> have traditionally been <a title="Iraqi inmate's account of abuse by US soldiers" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/05/world/the-struggle-for-iraq-inmate-iraqi-recounts-hours-of-abuse-by-us-troops.html">anecdotal</a>.</p>
<p>We may finally be seeing the effect of such &#8220;moral waivers&#8221;. Recently, a court martial in Washington <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/asia/US-Soldier-Sentenced-to-24-Years-in-Prison-in-Afghan-Murder-Case2-118577784.html">sentenced a US soldier to 24 years</a> in prison for murdering Afghan civilians with intent.It looks like unlike with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse">Abu Gharib</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_D._Steele#Iron_Triangle_Murders">Iron Triangle murders</a>, the US military has stopped protecting soldiers who commit crimes (while in active duty). While there is no evidence to say that the soldier was a &#8220;moral waiver&#8221; recruit, I don&#8217;t think that matters. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stjepan_Me%C5%A1trovi%C4%87">Dr. Stjepan Mestrovic</a> argues in his book <em><a title="Publisher's site for Rules of Engagement" href="http://www.algora.com/256/book/details.html">Rules of Engagement</a></em>, certain events, behavior, or tolerance creates a social atmosphere which affects the moral compass to the individuals in that society so that acts that would otherwise been considered immoral or wrong suddenly becomes acceptable, is rationalized, and condoned. The murder of Afghan civilians by US soldiers could well point to the creation of such an unhealthy social environment that has metastasized the soldiers&#8217; moral inclinations and driven them to misanthropic acts that have occurred almost beyond the individual&#8217;s volition.</p>
<p>I hope I am wrong. But I seriously doubt it.</p>
