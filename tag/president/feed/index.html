				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This happened on the evening of Nov. 4th. After Obama was pronounced as the new president of USA, a bunch of us decided to hit a near by bar for a few drinks. When we got there, we saw a bunch of Aggies with T-shirts that said &#8220;Beat the hell outta Obama&#8221;. Before I go any further, the message on the T-shirt is not to be taken literally, or as a racist comment. It&#8217;s an old Ag tradition that started with &#8220;Beat the hell outta (University of) Texas&#8221;, and now they just change the last word to anything they want. So don&#8217;t associate this with the lynching to black men in the southern slave states.</p>
<p>So yeah, when I saw those T-shirts, I knew they were Aggies and they were Republicans. As Obama was giving his acceptence speech we started hearing comments that went something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>He made it because the pussy liberals wanted to vote for a Muslim&#8230;</p>
<p>Looks like gold teeth and fried chicken will now be tax exempt&#8230;</p>
<p>We now have an Arab for a president. Looks like the terrorists won&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>And I am not making any of this up! The Aggies are notorious for their racist views, hate, and bias anyway. Patrix&#8217;s post on <a title="Egg tossing at Obama" href="http://www.ipatrix.com/egg-tossing-at-obama/">Egg tossing at Obama</a> (an incident which made it to the national news) should give you an idea of how antiquated (almost pre-integration) the Aggies&#8217; ideology is. In fact, <a title="Aggie Racism Marches on" href="../../../2008/09/02/aggie-racism-marches-on/index.html">my earlier post about Aggie racism</a> suggests an institutional investment in fostering such an environment.</p>
<p><a title="Hate stories about Obama's election" href="http://blogs.newamericamedia.org/yo/1476/the-hate-story-the-media-didnt-cover">In other news</a>: Here&#8217;s what a (University of) Texas football player Buck Brunette had to say about Obama&#8217;s election &#8220;All the hunters gather up, we have a [nigger] in the White House.&#8221; That&#8217;s what he said on his Facebook page and was promptly kicked off the team.</p>
