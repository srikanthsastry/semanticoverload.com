				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had an enjoyable evening yesterday all thanks to a fabulous performance by Gioia De Cari  <em><a title="Link to Unexpected Theatre" href="http://www.unexpectedtheatre.org/about">Truth Values</a>: One Girl&#8217;s Romp Through M.I.T.&#8217;s Male Math Maze</em>. It is an autobiographical account of Gioia&#8217;s years as a doctoral student in the<a title="Math Dept. at MIT" href="http://math.mit.edu/"> Math department at MIT</a>. The performance was a part of <a title="MIT 150" href="http://mit150.mit.edu/">MIT&#8217;s 150th anniversary</a> celebration.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 360px"><img title="Gioia De Cari in &quot;Truth Values&quot;" src="http://unexpectedtheatre.org/Images/Small_about_photo.jpg" alt="Gioia De Cari in &quot;Truth Values&quot;" width="350" height="205" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Gioia De Cari in &quot;Truth Values&quot;</p></div>
<p>Gioia is a self described &#8220;recovering mathematician&#8221; who has a great gift for writing, acting, and singing. (Oh, did I happen to mention <a title="Olsen and De Cari's website" href="http://www.olsondecariduo.com/">she is a soprano</a>?) Her play was unexpectedly funny and enjoyable. When I first received an email about it, I expected a litany of complaints about how hard it is for a woman to make it in math and science (largely male-dominated fields). But it wasn&#8217;t and yet it was, at the same time. It is said, &#8220;there is no story so good that it can&#8217;t be spoiled in the telling&#8221;. With Gioia, she had a fantastic story and told in the best manner possible, as a monologue/mono-act by the author/actress herself. It was funny, and it was sad, and best of all, no matter who you are, you couldn&#8217;t help but empathize with her. It offered a scathing and insightful look at an academic (sub)culture that was born out of the incidental male-dominance in mathematics (and sciences) and continues to serve as a deterrent for women to succeed in these fields. But Gioia wasn&#8217;t complaining, she was just holding up a mirror; and to ensure that the walls of prejudice do not block the message, she gift wrapped it with some irrepressible humor which was a treat to watch.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Gioia wrote the play as a response to former Harvard President <a title="Wikipedia page about Lawrence Summers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers">Lawrence Summers</a>’ (yes, the same Larry Summers who <a title="Full transcript of Obama's appearance on the daily Show in 2010" href="http://lincmad.blogspot.com/2010/10/full-transcript-of-obama-on-daily-show.html">Obama said &#8220;did a heckuva job&#8221;</a> on the Daily Show) statement that women are less represented than men in the sciences because there is a &#8221;greater variance in intelligence among men than women, and that this difference in variance might be intrinsic.&#8221; [<a title="Boston Globe article on Larry Summers' statement about &quot;intrinsic difference between the genders&quot;" href="http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2005/01/17/summers_remarks_on_women_draw_fire/">source</a>] Not surprisingly, that controversy contributed to <a title="Article discussing Summers' resignation as Harvard President" href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2006/2/22/summers-resigns-shortest-term-since-civil/">his resignation</a> the following year.</p>
<p>The performance schedule for Truth Values is available <a title="Performance Schedule of Truth Values" href="http://www.unexpectedtheatre.org/performance_schedule">here</a>. If you get a chance to attend it, then do not miss out! I promise you that you will not be disappointed.</p>
<p>I close this post with a video by Gioia discussing her play:</p>
