				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/01/tsa_chihuahua.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-395 alignright" title="TSA Chihuahua" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2010/01/tsa_chihuahua.png" alt="" width="165" height="300" /></a>Indeed, TSA is much like the Chihuahua that Jeff Dunham talks about in the opening act of his &#8220;Spark of Insanity&#8221; tour. The sketch goes something like this [<a title="Jeff Dunham on Chihuahua" href="http://www.tubechop.com/watch/44332">source</a>]:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I figured out size does matter in the canine brain. Bill &#8211; golden retriever &#8211; very smart animal. When he was a puppy and I had to potty train him, if he pooped on the living room carpet, I stuck his nose in it. Three time later, he figured out &#8216;Oh, I am not supposed to crap here!&#8217;. Next two dogs, the same thing.</p>
<p>Now the little brain-dead Chihuahua comes along. She poops on the living room carpet, I stick her nose in it; three times later she thinks &#8216;Oh, I am not supposed to crap ever!&#8217;&#8230;.. And that&#8217;s why they shake.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The TSA did pretty much the same thing. On December 26th 2009, <a title="AP sources: Attempt to blow up airliner foiled" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_airliner_disturbance">Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab tried to blow up a Northwest Airlines plane</a> as it was preparing to land in Detroit. The usual noises followed ranging from <a title="Hoekstra: Blame Obama For Near Bombing Of Airliner" href="http://tpmlivewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/12/rep-pete-hoekstra-r-mi-says-blame-obama-for-near-bombing-of-airliner.php">blaming Obama</a> for the incident to demanding that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/yemen/6906861/Detroit-terror-attack-passenger-profiling-failed.html">all Muslims be made to go through special security checks</a>.</p>
<p>This incident could have been prevented if Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab was not allowed to board the plane in the first place. All the warning signs were there: Umar&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/12/26/ap/government/main6025129.shtml">father had warned the CIA</a> about Umar,  <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/12/31/beware-the-nigerian-from-yemen-115875-21932857/">anti-terror chiefs were warned five months</a> ago that an al-Qaeda cell in Yemen was plotting a deadly attack using &#8220;The Nigerian&#8221;. Disregarding both these (vital) pieces of information, here is someone who bought one-way tickets from Nigeria to Yemen to the USA paying only cash and with no baggages to check-in. This should have raised suspicions, and he should have been singled out for additional security and through additional scanners.</p>
<p>Metaphorically speaking, TSA pooped on the living room carpet and the Nigerian stuck their nose into it! One would expect a rational response to be better mechanisms to profile passengers, not according to race or religion (which seems to be what all the rage is about), but according to passenger behavior. In this case, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/25/AR2009122501355.html">someone on the &#8220;alert list&#8221;</a>, paying cash for a one-way transcontinental flight, with no check-in baggage would qualify as suspicious behavior. That would be saying &#8220;Oh, I am not supposed to crap here!&#8221;.</p>
<p>Instead, the TSA chooses to think &#8220;I am not supposed to crap ever!&#8221; and decides to put <a title="Passengers face security crackdown after failed airliner bomb plot" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6969073.ece">ALL passengers through additional security increasing</a> [<a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/world/163694/restrictions-rise-after-terrorism-attempt">Bangkok Post</a>, <a href="http://euobserver.com/9/29201">EUObserver</a>, <a title="New Restrictions Quickly Added for Air Passengers" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/us/27security.html">NY Times</a>].</p>
