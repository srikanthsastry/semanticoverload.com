				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having lived in the US for over three and a half years, having seen the politics here, the blatant lies, the discrimination, the complete lack of moral responsibility or compass that the administration and the public choose to brandish, I have always savored the hard earned yearly trips back to India in December. I have always felt a sense of freedom in India that I missed here in the US. But the events that unfolded in the last two weeks have forced me to re-evaluate this freedom I perceived. It was perhaps, all an illusion.</p>
<p><span id="more-140"></span></p>
<p>One of the rights the US prides itself upon is freedom, the first amendment, right to free speech. Something we sorely lack, and often even fail to recognize in India. I didn&#8217;t feel the pinch until I read about how Taslima Nasreen was treated in India. What happened? India was supposed to be bastion of freedom for people around the sub-continent. We provided asylum for people  like Dalai Lama and Taslima Nasreen. But now we seemed to have turned our backs on the very people we promised to protect.</p>
<p><a title="Taslima Nasreen in Europe" href="http://theseoultimes.com/ST/?url=/ST/db/read.php?idx=6381" target="_self">Taslima Nasreen was forced out of India</a>, and for what? Expression herself? For writing a book? For choosing to  say &#8216;hey, lets stop and think about what we are doing&#8217;? What was her crime? I guess she wrote the wrong kind of book. Maybe, if she had written about the <a href="http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080306/main5.htm">demise of the Mumbai</a> thanks to those malignant north Indians, she would have been allowed to stay. Or maybe if she had written about how <a title="Tibetian Monks Protest" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3630653.ece" target="_self">Tibetians are a terrorist organization</a> undermining China&#8217;s sovereignty, she would have been received with open arms in New Delhi. Or maybe if she had written about <a href="http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200803211311.htm">M.F.Hussain&#8217;s attack on Hinduism</a> for $1.6M, she would received an honorary &#8216;Hindu&#8217; title. After all, isn&#8217;t that what free speech is about?</p>
<p>And here I was admonishing the US for all of its wrongdoings. As I wake up and smell of the coffee, I hang my head in shame.</p>
