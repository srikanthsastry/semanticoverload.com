				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just following up on my <a title="Tweet about lost dog I found in Bryan" href="http://twitter.com/chrosyn/statuses/25082640972">earlier tweet about the lost dog</a>.</p>
<p>I found a dog lost and confused between Lynn Dr. and Sulphur Springs Rd. on South College Ave. in Bryan [<a title="Google Maps link with a marker for the location where I found the dog." href="http://maps.google.com/maps?z=16&amp;q=30.637433,-96.356525%28Found%20dog%29">Google Maps link</a>] at around 9:45 PM in the evening. I saw it as I was driving to KEOS. It was sitting in the middle of the road and all traffic was going around her. I pulled over and tried to get it to move to the side. It was dazed and very afraid. At first it started moving away from me in fear, but I managed to get her out of the street. She is obviously someone&#8217;s pet since she has a collar.</p>
<p>I called Brazos police who then transferred to me Brazos animal control. To make a long story short, I have dropped it off at the fenced side yard at Brazos Animal Shelter. Everyone in Bryan/College Station area please spread the word so that the owner may collect the dog. I fear that if the owner does not claim her in three days, she might be put down (Brazos animal shelter it not a no-kill shelter; they kill animals that they deemed not likely to be adopted).</p>

<p>Here are a few pictures of the dog to help the owner identify it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a really nice and friendly dog. I&#8217;ll be really sad if it is put down. Please share this post on Facebook/Twitter/MySpace/listserv/email or any other means to get the owner to see it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My month long vacation back home in Bangalore began on the 10th of this month. It started with a visit to the <a title="Big Banyan Tree - wikimapia" href="http://wikimapia.org/104457/Big-Banyan-Tree-Bangalore">Big Banyan Tree</a>. It is a 400 year old <a title="Banyan Tree: Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banyan">Banyan Tree</a> (that&#8217;s Strangler Fig, for you Yankees ;) ) that spans over 2 acres.</p>
<p>It was quite a sight to see with aerial prop roots all over the place.</p>
<div><div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><img title="Big Banyan Tree - Entrance" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/semanticoverload/BlogEntries/big%20banyan%20tree/IMG_0397.jpg" alt="View of the Big Banyan Tree upon entering the premises" width="640" height="426" /><p class="wp-caption-text">View of the Big Banyan Tree upon entering the premises</p></div></div>
<p><span id="more-273"></span><br />
It was difficult to tell where the center of the tree was. No matter which part of the tree you saw, you seemed to see the center with similar trunks and branches all over the the place! Here is shot of the tree which look like its the center:</p>
<div><div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><img title="Big Banyan Tree: Is this the trunk?" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/semanticoverload/BlogEntries/big%20banyan%20tree/IMG_0469.jpg" alt="Big Banyan Tree: Is this the trunk?" width="640" height="426" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Big Banyan Tree: Is this the trunk?</p></div></div>
<p>Here is another one that seems to suggest an old &#8216;main trunk&#8217; that no longer is:</p>
<div><div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><img title="Big Banyan Tree: The old trunk perhaps?" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/semanticoverload/BlogEntries/big%20banyan%20tree/IMG_0464.jpg" alt="Big Banyan Tree: The old trunk perhaps?" width="640" height="426" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Big Banyan Tree: The old trunk perhaps?</p></div></div>
<p>From the looks of it, the tree is still growing. I saw several aerial prop roots still growing towards the ground. 400 years old and still kicking!</p>
<div><div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 650px"><img title="Big Banyan Tree: Prop roots are still growing" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/semanticoverload/BlogEntries/big%20banyan%20tree/IMG_0412.jpg" alt="Big Banyan Tree: Prop roots are still growing" width="640" height="426" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Big Banyan Tree: Prop roots are still growing</p></div></div>
<p>Ironically, the most interesting part of the visit was not the tree itself. It was the happenings around the tree that was the most fascinating. The imitation of forms between a man and a monkey had me glued for over 30 minutes! Here&#8217;s a glimpse of what I saw.</p>
<table border="0">
