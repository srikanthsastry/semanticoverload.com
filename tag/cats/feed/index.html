				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #FF0000;">CORRECTION!</p>
<p>As has been duly pointed out by the CATS Project Founder in the comment, no email was sent. It is a page on the CATS website. My comment still stands though&#8230;. This is still really funny! :)<br />
<del datetime="2008-01-30T20:43:02+00:00">This was an email sent to a group of investors by Cognizo Technologies (apparently). One of the investors forwarded it to me. You can help but chuckle at this one :)</del></p>
<blockquote><h2>Investors</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.catsone.com/">CATS</a> has been a self funded / organically grown project of <a href="http://www.cognizo.com/">Cognizo Technologies</a>. We are not really looking for any funding. That said, if you are an investor, AND understand the space, AND understand open source, AND just plain and simple&#8230;get it, please do call us.</p>
<p>Please just don&#8217;t ask for a business plan. If after browsing this website and reading about CATS, you are still looking for a business plan&#8230;.ahemm&#8230;.you are not exactly the kind of help we are looking for.</p>
<p>We are always looking to meet new people so do feel free to <a href="https://www.catsone.com/index.php?a=contact_us">contact us</a> and introduce yourself.</p>
