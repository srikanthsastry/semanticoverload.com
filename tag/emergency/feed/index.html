<p>The best reaction that US could give was that <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-30315520071103">it was &#8216;disappointed&#8217;</a> (that is was &#8216;deeply disturbed&#8217; and <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h1aBshjF1CnfJ4noaEXA_Vb8dm-gD8SMANS04">&#8216;urges&#8217; Pakistan to return to democracy</a>). Disappointed!? Is that it? Whatever happened to all the rhetoric about being pro-democracy and restoring democracy in the world one botched fiasco (translation: Iraq) at a time? But wait, isn&#8217;t Pakistan (translation: Musharraf) an ally in the American war <em>of</em> terror? So I guess anything that Musharraf does is pro-democracy, given that Bush and Mushrraf are bosom buddies and all. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Washington tows Musharraf&#8217;s line on this one, <em>viz.</em> that <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-30316220071103?sp=true">he did it for democracy</a>!</p>
