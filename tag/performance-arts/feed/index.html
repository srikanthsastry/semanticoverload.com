				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saturday evening was a blast! Anjali got us tickets for the rock show at PESIT (an engineering college in the located in the fringes of civilization). She couldnt make it, and was pretty sore about it. I must admit that she did miss something good, my heart goes out to her. She actually went out of her way to get the tickets for us even though she knew she couldnt make. She is a real sweet angel.</p>
<p>The &#8220;us&#8221; were <a href="http://www.moonjungle.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Vipin</a>, <a href="http://mridulm.blogspot.com/">Suski</a>, Roshan and myself. We got there about 15 min past 6. we were 15 min late into the show, but didnt miss much. The show was opened by the PESIT rock band. They were good, but not to my taste. They seemed majorly influenced by progressive rock, they even attempted a dream theatre cover. They have talent, but need a lot of work. For a college band, they are far out!</p>
<p>After a 45 min. performance by Phenome (the PESIT college band), <strong>Antaragni</strong> came in to save that day. They are a fusion band judged as the best new band in bangalore by Radio City. They played some great music. The fusion element was refreshing. There were some great jugalbandis with the violin, guitar and drums taking turns. They band has great talent. They are far better than the likes of Euphoria. The best part of the whole show was that, all the songs and instrumentals were self compositions and they sounded great! They lacked the refinement of a professional band, but I guess it will come when they start releasing their albums.</p>
<p>They had the college kinds on their feet and screaming&#8230; but then, anything fast, and on a higher octave can get them on their feet and screaming :)</p>
<p>They played some amazing instrumental peices that would have forced an applause even from their nemesis. But, I couldnt help noticing a pattern of monotony in all their songs. Their album, I fear, might end up sounding alike from the begining to the end.</p>
<p>Seeing the audience there, we realized how long it has been sicne we were students. The feelng was odd. It was like, we were among kids. Their antics, the crowd reaction to when the singer scaled an octave or any instrument was playing a crescendo was, to say the least, amusing in a funny sort of way. And you could see loads of guys trying to hit on girls.. such a common sight in the college, but had almost forgot about it. and then there were couples tryign to inch towards the first base&#8230; it was fun watching the entire spectacle. Makes me wonder if I will ever be able to be a college kid again, even of I had the oppertunity&#8230;. we have all &#8220;grown up&#8221; so much&#8230;.yet each time I think of going back to college, there is a twinkle in my eye :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just got off the newspaper with a small news item that Diana Ross was jailed for drunken driving. That set me thinking on the how the world of music has transformed beyond recognition over the decades. It&#8217;s been a long way from the <em>Beatles</em> to <em>Darkness.</em> I guess it all started with flower power and the hippies. But inevitably since then, music has always been associated with sex and drugs. In fact we have a whole genre of music based on this. Psychedelic rock and acid rock are just this. Bands like Greatful Dead fostered this style of music into a genre, and Pink Floyd pushed it into the stratosphere of  mainstream music.</p>
<p>What is it about drugs that has helped it permeate into the music industry like a virulent pathogen? If it is the mood/mind altering property of its, then why should the musicians be any different from the doper on the streets? Why is it that if a doper is begging for some drugs he is loser in life, but if a rock star is doing drugs, it&#8217;s his lifestyle? Having said that, lets not forget that the most terribles losses to the world of music has been due to drug abuse. <strong>Jimi Hendrix</strong> choked on his own vomit simply because he was too damn doped to turn over to his sides when he started puking. <strong>Jim Morrison</strong> (of &#8220;The Doors&#8221; fame) dies at the age of 27 of alcohol abuse. Rolling Stones magazine referred to <strong>Steven Tyler</strong> and <strong>Joe Perry</strong> (of the the <em>&#8220;Aerosmith&#8221;</em> fame) as the <strong>&#8220;toxic twins&#8221;</strong>. And the list goes on, it&#8217;s endless.</p>
<p>Needless to say, all this arguments and facts seem to reflect the fact that the morals in the industry are, so to say, &#8220;liberal&#8221;. But this is not endemic to the western rock-n-roll alone. In fact we have instances in the indian classical music scene. <strong>Balamurali Krishna</strong>, one of the greats in carnatic music, is, more often than not, high on alcohol while performing. He says he cant do without it. The story of <strong>Pt. Ravi Shankar&#8217;s</strong> daughter <strong>Norah Jones</strong> in only too well known (BTW she has just released her second album <em>&#8220;Feels like home&#8221;</em>). In fact, classical musicians and dancers have often been associate with &#8220;loose&#8221; morals and bohemian lifestyle. What strikes me funny is that  the people whose talents are praised beyond compare, whose performances are savoured by millions, are also the ones whose lifestyle would repulse you. It&#8217;s like they are walking on the razor&#8217;s edge, and a slighten movement bleeds their feet, and while we cheer the act, unmindful of the blood, they are dying everyday. Their life is spiralling out of control. More often than not, their personal life is in shambles. They may be broken in body, but not in spirit, and that&#8217;s what keeps them going. It&#8217;s sad the way things are. Being an audiophile, it&#8217;s difficult for me to imagine that the people who make great music are doing it at the cost of their lives. Makes me wonder if it&#8217;s all worth it.</p>
