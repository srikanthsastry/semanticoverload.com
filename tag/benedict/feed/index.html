<p>The <a title="Vatican Says that evolution in fine" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSLG62672220080916">pope said that evolution is ok</a> by him. So I guess that means that the Catholics can down become evolutionary biologists/anthropologists and such. I wonder what happened in 150 years that changed Vatican&#8217;s mind? Given that Catholics assume that Pope has God&#8217;s mandate over Christiandom, Pope must have been talking to god on a fairly regular basis. My best guess is that the Pope got a call from God and it went something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hey Benedict! Wassaap? Its your old man here. Howz my favorite catholic doin&#8217;?&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yeah, by the way, Darwin and I had a long chat some time back. He&#8217;s a really nice fella. He&#8217;s got an awesome beard too. Nothing like mine, but hey, gotta give props where its due right? Anywayz, so Darwin and I were chillin&#8217; out smoking some reefer and stuff&#8230; hey, now don&#8217;t be judging, I created it remember? So yeah, I realized Darwin&#8217;s a cool dude after all. We play checkers all the time now. He&#8217;s awesome, he always let me win! So I&#8217;ve decided to let him into heaven&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? Oh, the evolution thing? Yeah&#8230; well&#8230; tell ya what, we are still vetting Einstein to be let into heaven. All the Democratic angels want him in, but the Republican angels are giving him a tough time, with he being a Jew and not believing in my Son and all, but we&#8217;ll get there&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Einstein? Dude! I am sick and tired of there harps all over the place, I need something different, and Einstein&#8217;s awesome on the violin. Anywayz, coming back, here&#8217;s what you can do, you can tell everyone that evolution is now cool with Me, and that the whole creating the universe in 7 days.. well Einstein here tells me that if I said that I was going at the speed of light when I created the universe, then somehow my watch slows down, and so my 7 days is really billions of years on earth. And that fits nicely with evolution and everything&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?! Me come down and say that myself? The last time I tried doing something like that they nailed my Son to a tree! No way pal! Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me!&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, I know its not going to be easy convincing everyone, but hey, its not the first time! Remember Galileo? Yeah, we managed to get people to be cool with him after 300 years, and this is just half that time. It&#8217;ll work out Benedict&#8230; tell ya what, you do this for me and I&#8217;ll throw in a couple of extra virgins when you get here. How about that?&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sweet! Gotta go pal. The whole global warming crap that people are into is keepin&#8217; me busy.. I got a few more hurricanes to create in the Atlantic, and yeah, I was tardy on the whole ice-sheet melting thing. Apparently <a title="Arctic Ocean Ice Retreats Less Than Last Year" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/science/earth/17ice.html?ref=world">it wasn&#8217;t as drastic as last year</a>. Gotta make up for that! Jeez, I need a vacation! Anywayz, gotta go, ciao.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
