				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just following up on my <a title="Tweet about lost dog I found in Bryan" href="http://twitter.com/chrosyn/statuses/25082640972">earlier tweet about the lost dog</a>.</p>
<p>I found a dog lost and confused between Lynn Dr. and Sulphur Springs Rd. on South College Ave. in Bryan [<a title="Google Maps link with a marker for the location where I found the dog." href="http://maps.google.com/maps?z=16&amp;q=30.637433,-96.356525%28Found%20dog%29">Google Maps link</a>] at around 9:45 PM in the evening. I saw it as I was driving to KEOS. It was sitting in the middle of the road and all traffic was going around her. I pulled over and tried to get it to move to the side. It was dazed and very afraid. At first it started moving away from me in fear, but I managed to get her out of the street. She is obviously someone&#8217;s pet since she has a collar.</p>
<p>I called Brazos police who then transferred to me Brazos animal control. To make a long story short, I have dropped it off at the fenced side yard at Brazos Animal Shelter. Everyone in Bryan/College Station area please spread the word so that the owner may collect the dog. I fear that if the owner does not claim her in three days, she might be put down (Brazos animal shelter it not a no-kill shelter; they kill animals that they deemed not likely to be adopted).</p>

<p>Here are a few pictures of the dog to help the owner identify it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a really nice and friendly dog. I&#8217;ll be really sad if it is put down. Please share this post on Facebook/Twitter/MySpace/listserv/email or any other means to get the owner to see it.</p>
