				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looks like Afridi&#8217;s comments (similar to the ones I talked about in<a title="Afridi’s Turncoat Act" href="../../../2011/04/04/afridis-turncoat-act/index.html"> my previous post</a>) are raising quite a storm in India and elsewhere, especially in the online community. He said something to the effect that Indians do not have as large a heart as Pakistanis and Muslims do. Since the proverbial <a title="TOI article: Muslim scholar slams Afridi's line" href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Muslim-scholars-slam-Afridis-line/articleshow/7879040.cms">fit hit the shan</a>, Afridi has gone into damage control mode claiming that<a title="Video: NDTV interview with Afridi" href="http://profit.ndtv.com/video/show/195596"> he was quoted out of context</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_829" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 209px"><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/04/5285420332_4fc0a23931.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-829 " title="Shahid Afridi" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2011/04/5285420332_4fc0a23931.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Afridi. Image source: http://www.flickr.com/photos/charaka/</p></div>
<p>The fury that came out of the Indian online community either in support of or against Afridi had the usual <a title="Aman Ki Asha" href="http://www.amankiasha.com/">Aman-ki-Asha</a> defense or <a title="Wikipedia article on State Sponsored Terrorism and Pakistan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-sponsored_terrorism#Pakistan">Pakistan-is-a-terror-supporter</a> attack. I will not comment on either side of the arguments except that I saw many good arguments on both sides. However, I do wish to make a point about &#8220;Pakistan is a terrorist state&#8221; versus &#8220;Pakistanis are terrorist sympathizers&#8221; argument that seems to have conveniently folded itself into the argument associated with Afridi&#8217;s statements.﻿</p>
<p>On one side, while many agree that the political establishment in Pakistan sympathizes with and actively supports terrorist acts against India, they caution that one should not claim that the state&#8217;s support for terrorism is the same as the people&#8217;s support for terrorism much like Muage vs. Zimbabweans. On the other side, there are many who argue that a state establishment cannot function without an approval from the masses (even a tacit approval through silence is sufficient). In the latter camp, <a title="Greatbong's blogpost about Afridi's comments" href="http://greatbong.net/2011/04/05/the-big-hearts/">Greatbong argues</a> that <a title="Salmaan Taseer assassaination" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmaan_Taseer#Assassin">assassination of moderates like Taseer</a> points to a popular sympathy (albeit a tacit one) for Islamic fundamentalism.</p>
<p>I agree with the sentiment that one should not equate the actions of the political establishment with the people of the state. This statement is easy to defend when talking about the people of the state, but the same arguments do not hold when you are considering individuals. The difference is the similar to how statistical inferences, while applicable to a large dataset, become irrelevant when considering the outcome of a single event. Let me explain. While the American public may not favor massive human rights violations in Iraq and may even be against the war in Iraq, you cannot claim the same to be true of some American individual. I know many Americans who actively support America&#8217;s invasion of Iraq and deposing of Saddam Hussain. I also know many Americans who oppose it.</p>
<p>The American I know who oppose the Iraq war are quick to blame their political establishment and, if pressed, are willing to offer their apologies to Iraqies and an outright admission that they oppose their goverment&#8217;s actions.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go back and consider Afridi&#8217;s comments specifically with respect to this argument &#8221;Pakistan is a terrorist state&#8221; versus &#8220;Pakistanis are terrorist sympathizers&#8221;. Reacting to Gautam Gambhir&#8217;s statement that India&#8217;s victory over Pakistan will help soothe the pain over 26/11 Mumbai attacks, Afridi said: &#8220;I think they were very stupid comments by Gautam Gambhir. I was not expecting this from Gautam. This is all politics, what do you know about who carried out the Mumbai attacks?&#8221; [<a href="http://www.indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/134319/sports/world-cup-afridi-slams-gambhir-for-2611-remark.html">source</a>]</p>
<p>Despite <a title="ISI's role in 26/11 attacks" href="http://www.lankaenews.com/English/news.php?id=10836">overwhelming</a> <a title="Headly reveals Pak role in 26/11 Mumbai attacks" href="http://ibnlive.in.com/news/david-headley-reveals-paks-role-in-2611-attacks/133350-3.html?from=tn">evidence</a> that <a title="Wikipedia article on attribution of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_of_the_2008_Mumbai_attacks">26/11 attacks received support from Pakistani establishment</a>, Afridi asserts that there is no knowledge of the perpetrators of 26/11. He could have distanced himself from the whole thing by simply saying &#8220;This is just politics.&#8221; and stopping there. But he did not. For some reason he felt compelled to defend the Pakistani establishment. That sounds like Afridi is batting for the Pakistani establishment. So I cannot give Afridi a reprieve on the &#8221;Pakistan is a terrorist state&#8221; versus &#8220;Pakistanis are terrorist sympathizers&#8221; schism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Contrary to common belief, the American export of terrorism or  terrorists is not a recent phenomenon, nor has it been associated only  with Islamic radicals or people of Middle Eastern, African or South  Asian ethnic origin. This dynamic belies the American belief that our  free, open and integrated multicultural society lessens the allure of  radicalism and terrorism for US citizens.</p></blockquote>
<p>Who do you think said that? <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Michael_Moore">Micheal Moore</a>? <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338357/quotes">Noam Chomsky</a>? Nah! &#8216;Actually, its the CIA. That&#8217;s right, the American Central Intelligence Agency. <a href="http://www.wikileaks.com/wiki/CIA_Red_Cell_Memorandum_on_United_States_%22exporting_terrorism%22,_2_Feb_2010">Wikileaks has more</a>&#8230;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Recently there have been reports of a terrorist group aligned with LeT planning on hijacking an Air India flight and  using paragliders to launch suicide attacks against India. The kind of lucidity, clarity, and specificity in the news reports seemed unusual (almost unprecedented) for India. Looks like among the lessons learnt from 26/11 is that it is not sufficient to just do your job, you need to make sure that your stakeholders (the people of India) know that you are doing your job. In other words PR/marketing. So are we going to see more 'transparency' from the government on intelligence information and credibility of terrorists threats?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently there have been reports of a terrorist group aligned with Al-Qaeda, LeT (<a title="Wikipedia entry for LeT &quot;army of the righteous&quot;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lashkar-e-Toiba">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a>, for the uninitiated) a.k.a. JuD (<a title="Wikipedia entry for JuD" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamat-ud-Dawa">Jamat-ud-Dawa</a>) planning on hijacking an Air India flight [source: <a title="News article titled &quot;Terror alert: Plan to hijack Indian plane&quot;" href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/terror-alert-plan-to-hijack-indian-plane/570428/">Indian Express</a>] and reports of LeT possibly using paragliders to launch suicide attacks against India [source: <a title="News article titled &quot;After hijack threat, now LeT paragliders&quot;" href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/after-hijack-threat-now-let-paragliders/570813/">Indian Express</a>]. These reports have prompted the home ministry to deploy air marshals on all flights [source: <a title="&quot;Following this input, the civil aviation ministry has directed all the airlines especially Air India to take extra steps besides asking Bureau of civil aviation security to deploy sky marshals on aircraft operating on such routes, the sources said. &quot;" href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Hijack-threat-AI-planes-put-on-high-alert/articleshow/5487289.cms">The Times of India</a>] and tighten security over vital installations [source: <a title="&quot;The intelligence input which came barely days ahead of Republic Day celebrations has prompted authorities to ensure a tight air security around all vital installations, official sources said here on Friday. &quot;" href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Lashkar-readies-para-gliders-to-launch-suicide-attack-on-India-Intel/articleshow/5488687.cms">The Times of India</a>].</p>
<p>The kind of lucidity and clarity in the news reports seemed unusual. Typically the reasons for such &#8220;high alert&#8221; is one of the following three:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Reactionary</strong>, that is, in response to confirmed terrorist activity. Examples:
<ul>
<li>July 14, 1997: Himachal Pradesh was put on alert after field officials admitted that terrorists have been entering Himachal for re-grouping and planning attacks [<a title="Indian Express article: &quot;Himachal Pradesh put on alert as militancy threatens State&quot;" href="http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19970715/19650033.html">source</a>].</li>
<li>June 28, 2003: Army formations were on full alert following a suicide attack on a Dogra battalion camp [<a title="June 28th 2003 - The Hindu news article: Army formations on full alert" href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2003/06/29/stories/2003062904510100.htm">source</a>].</li>
<li>July 22, 2003: Army formations in Jammu &amp; Kashmir were put of full alert following two major suicide attacks on army camps and intelligence reports that there may be more [<a title="Jully 22, 2003 Indian Express news article &quot;Pak pushing militants into Jammu region: Army&quot;" href="http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=23244">source</a>].</li>
<li>October 1, 2003: Troops along the Indo-Pak border were put on high alert after Pak army&#8217;s Border Action Teams provided cover fire to push terrorists into Jammu and Kashmir [<a title="01 Oct. 2003 Silicon India article: Troops put on alert along LoC to stop Pak sabotage group" href="http://www.siliconindia.com/shownews/Troops_put_on_alert_along_LoC_to_stop_Pak_sabotage_group-nid-20999.html">source</a>].</li>
<li>November 12, 2007: Army was placed on alert in Jammu &amp; Kashmir after terrorist &#8220;sleeper cells&#8221; had become active [<a title="Nov 17 2007 Bloombery news article &quot;India Says Army on Alert for Kashmir Terrorist Cells &quot;" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aLqqTH0oankA&amp;refer=home">source</a>].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Obvious</strong>: on occasions like the Republic day or Independence day, or during known periods of terrorist infiltration. Examples:
<ul>
<li>January 26, 2003: Delhi, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, and the Northeast were put under high alert to safeguard against terrorist threats to disrupt the Republic Day celebrations [<a title="PTI news: &quot;States under high alert for R-Day&quot;" href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/jan/25alert.htm">source</a>].</li>
<li>March, 18 2004: Indian forces were put on hight alert because the melting snow along the LoC at the end of winter increases terrorist infiltration [<a title="March 18 2004 The Times of India article &quot;Forces on alert as melting snow eases infiltration&quot;" href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/567248.cms">source</a>].</li>
<li>August 14, 2007: Security forces around New Delhi were on high alert for Independence day to safeguard against terror attacks [<a title="Aug 14, 2009 Bloomberg article &quot;India Boosts Independence Day Security; Keeps al-Qaeda in Mind&quot;" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&amp;sid=a7iIZdKv0RsI&amp;refer=india">source</a>].</li>
<li>August 15, 2008: India rolled out a security clampdown ahead of the Independence Day [<a title="Aug 15 2008 Reuters article &quot;India on high alert as it celebrates Independence Day&quot;" href="http://in.reuters.com/article/companyNews/idINDEL12225520080814">source</a>].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong> Secretive or vague</strong> information. Examples:
<ul>
<li>July 13, 2006: Army cantonments were put on high alert following intelligence reports that terrorists could carry our suicide attacks [<a title="July 13 2006 The Hindu article &quot;High alert in cantonments&quot;" href="http://www.hindu.com/2006/07/13/stories/2006071322920100.htm">source</a>].</li>
<li>January 11, 2007: Airports across India were put on high alter follows intelligence reports on possible attempt by terrorists to hijack an aircraft or storm airport terminals [<a title="Jan 11 2007 Indian Express article &quot;Airports on alert after terror threat&quot;" href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/airports-on-alert-after-terror-threat/20638/">source</a>].</li>
<li>January 16, 2008: Central security agencies were put on guard following intelligence reports of a possible suicide attack by a Pakistan-based militant group on &#8220;VIPs&#8221; in Jammu &amp; Kashmir [<a title="Jan 16 2008 PTI news article titled &quot;LeT, Jaish planning to attack Azad, Omar; Security revamped&quot;" href="http://www.thehindu.com/holnus/001200801161655.htm">source</a>].</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In contrast the news articles on possible hijacking and paragliding suicide attacks provided us with a lot more and specific information. It seemed to come with more authority, almost trying to convince us that the government is doing its job and is very serious about security. Looks like among the lessons learnt from 26/11 (and mind you that there ARE <a title="Wide Angle View of India: &quot;Improvements in security arrangements in India after 26/11 (Mumbai Terror Attacks)&quot;" href="http://nitawriter.wordpress.com/2009/11/26/improvements-in-security-arrangements-in-india-after-911/">changes in policy</a> and<a title="The Acorn: &quot;The change of NSA is a manifestation of deeper change&quot;" href="http://acorn.nationalinterest.in/2010/01/18/the-change-of-nsa-is-a-manifestation-of-deeper-change/"> execution effected by those lessons</a>) is that it is not sufficient to just do your job, you need to make sure that your stakeholders (the people of India) know that you are doing your job. In other words PR/marketing. So are we going to see more &#8216;transparency&#8217; from the government on intelligence information and credibility of terrorists threats?</p>
<p>Interestingly, in April 2003, security was beefed up around the Vaishno Devi Temple in Jammu &amp; Kashmir following (specific) intelligence warning about a possible suicide attack [<a title="PTI article in Indian Express dated April 2 2003: &quot;Intelligence warns attack on Vaishno Devi&quot;" href="http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=20223">source news article</a>]. The news article reported: &#8220;Although inputs regarding general threat perceptions are received regularly, the threat is specific this time,&#8221; the sources said. So, a less flattering interpretation is that Indian intelligence has been doing what it can, but its work was of really poor quality, and hence the secretive or vague information on terror threats, and hence a catastrophic intelligence failure that lead to 26/11. Post-26/11, there has been a revamping of the Intelligence and now we are finally getting quality intelligence.</p>
<p>A more cynical possibility is that the 2003 Vaishno Devi alter, and the recent two specific intelligence alert were all just accidents! Indian Intelligence simply got lucky, and so don&#8217;t expect anything much to change at all!</p>
<p>Wonder where the truth really lies&#8230;</p>
