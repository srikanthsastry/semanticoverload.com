				<h2 class="entry-title">Cultural Indoctrination</h2>
				<div class="entry-content">
<p>Everyone of us is a part of the cultural fabric that weaves into the communal identity of our society. We may adore it, hate it, accept it, try hard to shake it but the fact remains that we are still a part of it, and more importantly, it is a part of us. It&#8217;s not uncommon to come across people who criticize their culture, the society they live in, the dogma that has contributed to their intellectual evolution throughout their life. I am not trying to criticize these people. In fact, I have been a party to this quite so often. They (me included) often have a lot of sense in what they say, but hard as they may try, they can never really strive towards the Utopian values and break the socio-cultural prejudices that they grown up with so long.</p>
<p>I know lots of people who have their independent views and ideas, yet when the time comes to put it in action, the sheer pressure and opposition to it from all quarters &#8220;forces&#8221; them to toe the line. To be more specific, I know of acquaintances who had all along opposed dowry and vowed to ensure that they are never going to be a part of it, yet when it was time for them to get married, they were mute spectators to the entire negotiation that that the families participated in before the marriage. I refer to this as <strong>Cultural Indoctrination.</strong></p>
<p>Does that mean that when ever we talk of independent thinking, individuality, etc. more of then than not we are being rebels without a cause? Granted that most of the social reform movement, and cultural evolution have started from the actions of such individuals, but the numbers are very small. The majority simply talk (although they may mean every word of what they say), yet choke when it comes to action. So what does it really take to believe in what we claim to believe, and stick to our ends at all costs? If not all can do it, then who can? How do I know if I am one of the few who can?</p>
<p>And there are others who choose to dissassociate themselves from the entire community/society to pursue their ideals, views and most of them end up seeking acceptance in a society that accepts all that the individual rebelled against in his native community/society. I have a lot of this kind too. What is interesting is that, no matter how hard they try to divorce themselves from their native culture/society/coomunity, they always have something to say about it. They still crave for acceptance here, but refuse to admit it.</p>
<p>It is amazing how intense cultural indoctrination can be. No matter how hard you try, it will still be a part of you, the good and the bad. It is the your zone of stability, the corner stone of your sobriety when everything else around you is changing, forcing you to adapt. This has been my personal experience.</p>
<p>Since my childhood, I was taught shlokas and hindu hyms that I regularly chanted. After my 10th std. I stopped. I didnt see a point to it, and my folks didnt force me either. I was of the firm belief that morality or values can be achieved only through our actions and not through devotion, or the act of chanting mantras. I got into a hostel from my engineering, and my first few weeks in the hostel was horrible. I was inconsolably homesick and was clueless about everything. Ragging added salt to my wounds. And suddenly, without my knowledge I was humming these long forgotten shlokas and mantras to pacify these bouts of homesickness, and it worked wonderfully. I wasnt chanting it coz I suddenly started believing in them, or that they showed me the path to enlightenment. I did it because it was the only thing I could do to get back into my &#8220;zone of stability&#8221;. After a few months, after I was well settled with my new friends and the hostel, I stopped these daily chantings. My friend form college also shared the same experience. He used to do &#8220;sandhyavandaman&#8221;, he said that for those 15 min. it was like he was home, he didnt picture his family, or the pooja room where he used to do it. I was just an inner tranquil feeling that he was where he belonged.</p>
<p>It is the same manifestation that can be attributed to what we refer to as CDs (Confused Desis) and ABCDs (American Born Confused Desis). And its no wonder that among the worst jolts and shocks you can get, &#8220;cultural shock&#8221; is the worst.</p>
