<p>Saturday evening was a blast! Anjali got us tickets for the rock show at PESIT (an engineering college in the located in the fringes of civilization). She couldnt make it, and was pretty sore about it. I must admit that she did miss something good, my heart goes out to her. She actually went out of her way to get the tickets for us even though she knew she couldnt make. She is a real sweet angel.</p>
<p>The &#8220;us&#8221; were <a href="http://www.moonjungle.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Vipin</a>, <a href="http://mridulm.blogspot.com/">Suski</a>, Roshan and myself. We got there about 15 min past 6. we were 15 min late into the show, but didnt miss much. The show was opened by the PESIT rock band. They were good, but not to my taste. They seemed majorly influenced by progressive rock, they even attempted a dream theatre cover. They have talent, but need a lot of work. For a college band, they are far out!</p>
<p>After a 45 min. performance by Phenome (the PESIT college band), <strong>Antaragni</strong> came in to save that day. They are a fusion band judged as the best new band in bangalore by Radio City. They played some great music. The fusion element was refreshing. There were some great jugalbandis with the violin, guitar and drums taking turns. They band has great talent. They are far better than the likes of Euphoria. The best part of the whole show was that, all the songs and instrumentals were self compositions and they sounded great! They lacked the refinement of a professional band, but I guess it will come when they start releasing their albums.</p>
<p>They had the college kinds on their feet and screaming&#8230; but then, anything fast, and on a higher octave can get them on their feet and screaming :)</p>
<p>They played some amazing instrumental peices that would have forced an applause even from their nemesis. But, I couldnt help noticing a pattern of monotony in all their songs. Their album, I fear, might end up sounding alike from the begining to the end.</p>
<p>Seeing the audience there, we realized how long it has been sicne we were students. The feelng was odd. It was like, we were among kids. Their antics, the crowd reaction to when the singer scaled an octave or any instrument was playing a crescendo was, to say the least, amusing in a funny sort of way. And you could see loads of guys trying to hit on girls.. such a common sight in the college, but had almost forgot about it. and then there were couples tryign to inch towards the first base&#8230; it was fun watching the entire spectacle. Makes me wonder if I will ever be able to be a college kid again, even of I had the oppertunity&#8230;. we have all &#8220;grown up&#8221; so much&#8230;.yet each time I think of going back to college, there is a twinkle in my eye :)</p>
