<p>Occasionally I get in the morning with a really sick feeling inside. It almost like I am having a premonition that my day is not going to be good. And it does turn out that way, call it 6th sense or preconditioning of the mind, but it still works. The odd thing about getting up like that is that I cannot remember any dreams that I had the night before. All I know is that I open my eyes and my first thoughts are &#8220;oh fuck, it&#8217;s morning and the day&#8217;s started again!&#8221;. Today was one of those days.</p>
<p>I started my day at 6:45 and realized that I forgot to wash my cloths from last night. Not exactly my favourite chore, and to do that first thing in the morning&#8230;I&#8217;d rather have a hangover, than this. After I finish the chores, I get into the bathroom and as I am enjoying my shower, bang goes the door bell. I am soaking wet and dripping of soap and it&#8217;s the newspaper guy who wants me to pay the bill immediately coz I havent paid in 2 months. For for christ sake, I wasnt in India for past 3 weeks, how does he expect me to pay!! But hez not taking no for an answer. I either pay now or he stop delivering paper. I paid that son of a bitch, and by the time I got back into shower, I was dry, and so was the soap on me. Yuck, I hate that feeling.</p>
<p>I get ready to watch the match only to see the pathetic performance by the Indians&#8230; a perfect morale booster I must say! Disgusted, I take off to the office. Its been a while since I took my car out, over 3 weeks infact, and I crank it up. Amazingly it starts off without a hitch and I say to myself &#8220;Ah, the first thing that&#8217;s gone right today!&#8221; But I had forgotten a minor detail&#8230; the fuel gauge. Next thing you know, it&#8217;s just past Mount Carmel College, on to Cunningham Road and my car splutters to a halt. Damn! I was too quick in making that comment in the morning.</p>
<p>I push the car all the way to chandrika hotel and park it at the parking area. I take my bag and laptop out, and start wondering how do I go about now. Thanks to my absent minded actions, I was now locked out fo my car as well. That was just swell, the car keys were inside the car for the worl to see, and while I got hunting for fuel I have to just hope that my car is not going to end up as a gift to some thief on the roads!</p>
<p>I go to a local store to buy can and funnel and realize that I am all out of cash. Fortunately there is an ATM close by. I get there only to discover that it&#8217;s out of order. This was begining to get to me now.  I needed backup, before I lost my sanity. I called up anjali, she came down in abt 20 min, borrowed money from her, and finally managed to get my ass to the office.</p>
<p>My company has 2 offices, and I had given my ISDN router for reconfiguration (with the phone no. changing in Blore, the router needed to be reconfigured to connect from home to the office) at the other office. In all this mess, I forgot to get my gate pass and I couldnt take the router either :(</p>
<p>Talk about a bad day! could anything else go wrong? That remindes me of a line from Calvin and Hobbes &#8211; <strong>&#8220;The most remarkable thing about life is that, it&#8217;s never so bad that it cant get worse&#8221;</strong></p>
